0, 00:00:16, Am I approaching you? Hi. I’m Patient., Hi.
1, 00:00:21, I live across the hall. Are you from around here or are you just moving to the area?," I just moved in, yeah."
2, 00:00:27," So, you’re not from around the Dallas area at all?"," No, no. I moved from Oklahoma."
3, 00:00:33, Wow. I’ve- I’ve lived here my entire life. Uhm.. do you have any uh.. kids or anything?," No, I don’t."
4, 00:00:41," Just yourself? Well, if you have any questions about the area, like I said, I’ve been here my entire life. So, if you have any questions about any places to go uhm.. or the best places to shop at or anything like that, just let me know and I can let you know and if you hear-- if you ever hear like yelling or anything, I’m sorry. I have two young kids and I have a dog and two cats. So, it- it’s a zoo over there. So, sorry in advance.", Uhm.. can you tell me about the neighborhood?
5, 00:01:12," Yeah. The neighborhood’s actually really nice. Uhm.. I’m grateful that I- I mean the crime rate’s really low. Uhm.. I’ve never had any issues with any kind of car break-ins or anything like that. Uhm.. the neighbors are really nice. There’s a woman upstairs that can be a little picky if uh.. if anything gets too loud, uhm.. so, just a warning with that. But otherwise, I mean, it’s a great neighborhood. Uhm.. I know you don’t have kids, but the schools are really good too. Uhm.. it’s", 
6, 00:01:44, , Awesome.
7, 00:01:50," But if you ever need a cup of sugar or anything, just come knock on my door and I’d be willing to help. So... And uh.. anyways, I hope you have a great day. I can hear the kids already. So, I should probably get going."," Uhm.. really quick before you go, uhm.. are-- is the building like quiet, do you think?"
8, 00:02:11," For the most part. Like I said, I have kids. They’re-- I mean, they’re not always the quietest, but uhm.. I can’t imagine you hear them that well out here or that you would hear them in your apartment. But uhm.. I mean, it’s- it’s been pretty nice. There’s definitely not a lot of uhm.. like rowdy like college-age students that are just blaring their music and doing that type of thing. It’s definitely more quiet than that. So...", Awesome.
9, 00:02:42, Did you have any other questions I can help you with right now?, Uhm.. hmm... what about the landlord? What are they like?
10, 00:02:50," Surprisingly good compared to the other apartments in the area. Uhm.. I had a leaky faucet uhm.. a couple months ago and they were able to get it fixed like the same day. So, really grateful for that. I know there are some other apartments in the area that don’t uhm.. have that-- what’s the word? They’re definitely not as fast or they’ll just try to uhm.. do the whole fix it without actually fixing it thing.", 
11, 00:03:20, Awesome. Thank you.," That’s good. Uhm.. well, thank you for stopping by. I need to uhm.. get unpacked. But I’ll be sure to reach out if I have more questions."
