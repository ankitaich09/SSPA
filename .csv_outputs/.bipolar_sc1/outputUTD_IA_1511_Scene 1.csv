0, 00:00:13, Good morning. How are you doing? My name is Patient and I stay across the street and I want to be the first to welcome you into our new- into your new apartment.," Oh, good morning. Thank you so much. My name’s Interviewer."
1, 00:00:24," Hi, Interviewer. Are you- are-- do you like it so far?"," Yeah. I haven’t been here too long, but it’s nice."
2, 00:00:30," Oh, okay. You’ve gotten everything moved in? Do you need any help?"," No help for now, but thank you."
3, 00:00:35," Okay. Well, I’m about to go to work. I just wanted to introduce myself and if you need me later, just come on across, knock on the door and if you need some help, I’ll come over and help you."," Okay. Uhm.. before you go, uh.. since I’m new to the area, could you tell me about this neighborhood?"
4, 00:00:52," Well, it’s safe and sound. You don’t have to worry about any break-ins or anything like that. All the neighbors are just nice as they can be. The kids are properly respectful. <laughs> You don’t have to worry about anything. I haven’t had any problems and I’ve been over here ten years."," Oh, that’s good."
5, 00:01:12," So, you should be okay-- better than okay. Don’t worry about anything. We all look out for each other.", That’s good to know.
6, 00:01:23," So, if you have any more questions, I get off about four o’clock and I’ll be home.", Okay.
7, 00:01:30," And if you want to come over and talk, we can talk then. Right now, I’m running just a little bit late."," All right. If I could hold you for just a second longer, uhm.. what is the landlord like here?"
8, 00:01:43," She’s laid back. She’s a nice individual. If you have a problem, she’ll help you with your problem. So, you won’t have to worry about anything as far as something that’s going on with your rent or in your apartment. She’s always on time. She’s very-- just a- a very polite person. she’s easygoing, laid back.", Okay. That’s good and is it safe to walk in the neighborhood in the evening? I like to walk my dog.
9, 00:02:20," Well, I walk my dog about ten or eleven. So, it’s pretty safe then. So, I’m quite sure it will be safe for you to walk your dog. What type of dog do you have?", A German Shepherd.
10, 00:02:30," Oh, you shouldn’t have any problems walking that dog.", Mm-hmm and uhm.. is the building overall quiet?
11, 00:02:49," It’s quiet except for the weekend. I’m not gonna say it’s too noisy on the weekend, but we have some neighbors that like to have a little get-together with their family. They are nice enough to invite you. So, you won’t have to worry about that."," Oh, okay."
12, 00:03:02," And they’re pre- some pretty good, nice people. They’ll feed you and whatever else you- you like to do.", Okay. That’s great to know.
13, 00:03:09," Pretty much. They’re some really, really, really nice neighbors over here. That’s one thing I really love about about the apartment complex. My neighbors are sweet. We all get along. If you decide you want to do something, you got your music up a little bit loud or you need to use an extra parking spot for someone that’s coming over, just let them know and they’ll work around it. There are some nice neighbors around here. I haven’t experienced any bad blood between me and any of the neighbors.", That’s great to know. That sounds awesome.
14, 00:03:34, Mm-hmm.," All right. Well, thank you so much. I’ll let you get to work."
15, 00:03:37, All right., Thank you.
16, 00:03:38,wer: You too., Bye-bye.
