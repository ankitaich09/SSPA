1, 00:00:13,"  Hi, I noticed that there's a new uh.. that there's a- a moving van out. I wanted to come introduce myself. Would you happen to be the new neighbor? Are you moving in?","  Yes, I am! My name is Interviewer."
2, 00:00:25,"  Hi, Interviewer. Well, I'm Patient. It's nice then to uhm.. have you uh.. into the new apartments. Uh.. just want to let you know that this is a really great place to stay. I've been here for about three years now, and it's so pet friendly. Do you have any pets?",  I do. I have two cats.
3, 00:00:42,"  Oh, wow. Well, I have two dogs, but they're cat lovers as well.",  Okay.
4, 00:00:47,"  So, uh.. and up the street uh.. about a block-and-a-half, there is a uh.. a animal park. So, I've seen cats as well as dogs. You know, it used to be dog parks, but now they coexist together. So, but Interviewer, I am so glad uh.. to meet you, and I do hope to see you soon. I can't uhm.. I have to go, but I just had to take the time out to come and say, hi, welcome to the neighborhood, Interviewer.","  Thank you! Uhm.. before you go. I was wondering uhm.. since I'm new to the area, could you tell me a bit about the neighborhood?"
5, 00:01:20,"  Well, one of the reasons I picked this particular location is because it has the elementary school, and I have a small son. And so, it's uh.. walking distance, a very high-rated school. And that's what dro-- you know, draw, you know, kind of initially drawn me over to this area. Uh.. I love to-- you know, we walk, you know, uh.. to school. Walk him to school every day, and then I walk him home. So, and uh.. also, it's very uh.. kind of I want to say ecofriendly, but it's not a lot of cars up and down the road. We do a lot of biking here, walking, very casual", 
6, 00:01:55, ,  Oh! That sounds great.
7, 00:02:03,"  Yeah, okay. Is it-- are there-- is there anything else before uhm.. before I go?",  Uhm.. uh.. what is the landlord like here?
8, 00:02:13,"  Well, uhm.. <clears throat> he's very laid-back, very casual. Uhm.. I don't know if, you know, what your lease is, but he-- it- it says, you know, rent is due by the 5th, but there is so many times I've paid him on the following Friday or whatever. He's-- as long as you get it to him, he does not complain. Uhm.. uh.. I think he's a retired police officer, actually, so.",  Oh!
9, 00:02:38,"  Yeah, that really uh.. helps, too. But he's really kind. So, you wouldn't even be able to tell by just meeting him, but uh.. I know you'll like it here. I know you will.","  Yeah, thanks."
10, 00:02:48,"  And I do live across, right across the walk, just in case you didn't reali-- you know, you don't realize where I came from, but I'm right across the walk from you. So, I look- look forward to it, to knowing you.","  Okay, well, thank you so much for coming to meet me, and I- I hope to see you around."
11, 00:03:00,"  All right, bye.",  Thank you!
