5, 00:01:00," Well, I would tell you the neighborhood is really nice. Uhm.. if you’re looking for places to eat, I’m not really sure. But I would tell you at night, just make sure your car is locked. All right, have a good day.", What is the landlord like?

12, 00:02:57," I would tell you yes because I wa-- I walk at night and I haven’t had any issues. The only real reason I said that is because you just don’t know once, you know, everyone sleeps. So, I always tell everyone to lock up their car."," Okay. All right. Well, I still need to finish unpacking. But thank you for coming by."
