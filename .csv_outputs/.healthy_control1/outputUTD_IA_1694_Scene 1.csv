I don't have children either, but sometimes I like to go in there and just kinda swing uhm.. but uh.. the neighbors around here are pretty great. Uh.. it's really close to shopping and uhm.. supermarkets, and if you have any problems with the bus route I'll be happy to give you a ride sometime.","  Okay. Yeah, that's very nice. Thanks."
10, 00:02:38,"  Thank you. Okay. Is there anything else you have a question about, hon?",  Uhm.. have you lived here long?
