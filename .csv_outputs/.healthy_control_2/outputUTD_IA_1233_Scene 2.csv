1, 00:00:13," Hello, Interviewer. Uh.. I was calling uh.. to get a timeline on what time you’ll- you’ll send someone to correct the leak in my ceiling."," Mm-hm. Uhm.. I’m sorry I haven’t had enough time to get over to fix it, but I’ve been very busy."
2, 00:00:30," I understand. It-- So, have I. It’s uh.. it’s becoming a problem. Uhm.. We’ve-- I’ve put buckets underneath and it’s uh.. it’s becoming a hazard. So, I’d like to get an idea, so that I can either be here or- or decide if I want to move somewhere else."," Uhm.. I do have a list and you’re on my list. However, there are other problems at this time that are more serious."
3, 00:00:55," I see. Well, I’m trying to be understanding. Uhm.. It’s just uh.. difficult to enjoy my apartment with the leak and uhm.. I think I paid my rent on time, so I’d like to get this uh.. taken care. Can you give me an- an idea about would it be within the next three days or a week from now? I just kind of want to have an idea when it would be corrected."," Uhm.. Based on the other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours, uh.. it may be a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to come by."
4, 00:01:29," Okay. Uhm.. Well, that’s-- w- will there be any discount on my rent next month, considering the inconvenience that this is causing?"," We can talk about that, of course, when I come by."
5, 00:01:45, Okay. All right.," I can’t say anything for sure at this time, though."
6, 00:01:50," Okay. Uhm.. Well, I- I appreciate your candor, uh.. but you said within-- so- so, at this point, you're saying that within the next seven days that the problem should be corrected?", A week or two weeks. I can’t guarantee.
7, 00:02:07, No guarantee. Okay. Uh.., Uhm.. And I do do all the repairs myself for the whole building. Uhm..
8, 00:02:20, Really?, Yes.
9, 00:02:22," Wow. Wow. Well, that’s terrible. Maybe you should considering hiring someone, if there’s that many problems, if there’s that many issues. Uh.. You may want to consider subbing it out to a- a contractor."," Yes. We’ll see in the future. Uhm.. And, also, uhm.. it didn’t sound that bad the last time you called."
10, 00:02:45," It’s gotten worse. Yeah, it’s gotten worse and it’s creating a-- it’s making the-- my uh.. home inhabitable [sic]. I’m going to have to stay over my friend’s house, because the noise from the dripping and then the changing the wa-- having to change the bucket of water more, because it’s- it’s dripping more, uhm.. So, it’s annoying. So, I just got-- I just want to get an idea when it- when it’ll be over, when it’ll- it’ll be corrected. But, uhm.. if you're just doing it by yourself, I-", 
11, 00:03:17, , All right. Uhm.. I’ll give you a call uhm.. the day that I’m going over there.
12, 00:03:30, So--, In the next week or so.
13, 00:03:32, Next week or so?, All right.
14, 00:03:34," All right, thank you.", Mm.. You're welcome. Bye-bye.
