0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:15," Hey, how are you doing?", Fine.
2, 00:00:18," Good. Uhm.. hi, I was uh-- did you get my messages about the leak that was in my apartment? Uhm.. well, it was a leak. Now, it’s like a puddle in my living room. Uhm.. is there anything we’re gonna do about that anytime soon or where do we go from here?"," I’m sorry I haven’t had enough time to get over to fix it, but I’ve been very busy."
3, 00:00:44," Okay. Uhm.. all right. Well, it’s causing a lot of damage to the uh.. you know, to the interior of the home. Uh.. I don’t want to be held responsible for it going through the par-- going through the carpet and possibly leaking on to the- the neighbor that I have below me. Uhm.. I think we probably need to take care of it sooner than later. Uhm.. unless you want other damages, you know, to the apartment below me. Uhm.. I mean, is there anything we can possibly do? Is there anyone who can come", 
4, 00:01:15, , I do all the repairs myself for the whole building.
5, 00:01:29," Okay. Okay. Well, uhm.. so, do you think you’re gonna be able to come out today or are you gonna at least try? Uhm.. the reason- the reason I’m so persistent in this is because there’s probably some kind of health code violation that we’re definitely in like, you know, definitely violating to some extent. Uh.. surely there can’t be, you know, just standing water in- in someone’s living room. Uhm.. so, what do you think you’re gonna be able to do about this?"," I have a list and you are on the list, but there are other problems that are more serious."
6, 00:02:09," Okay. Well, uhm.. I think what I’m gonna do is- is there any possible way that I can maybe get someone else’s number that can help me or should I just maybe, I don't know, probably, you know, call the city to, you know-- I’m pretty sure this goes against health code violations and uh.. I can’t be subjected to this-- living in this condition. So, do you think", 
7, 00:02:39, , Uhm.. is there anything that you’ve done about the problem so far?
8, 00:02:51," No. I’m not the landlord. I just-- I live here and it says in my contract when I- when I originally signed for it for me to contact you and bring it to your attention uhm.. immediately, which I’ve done that repeatedly and now, I’m talking to you now. So, uh.. I just want to know which route to go, if- if I’m gonna be able to get you to take care of it and if I can’t then can I go with my plan B?"," Okay. Well, I’ll try to head over there later today and see the leak for myself."
9, 00:03:21, Awesome. I appreciate that., All right.
10, 00:03:23, Thank you., You have a good day.
