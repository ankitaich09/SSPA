0,00:00:00, ," Hi.  This is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:13," Hi, Interviewer.  This is Patient.  I’m calling you about the leak that I called you about last week.  I’ve noticed it’s getting pretty bad.  Is it possible that you come over and take a look at it?"," I’m sorry I haven’t had enough time to get over to fix it, but I’ve been very busy."
2, 00:00:35," Oh, I do understand, ya know.  We all have things to do.  I just, you know, not only could it become potentially a health hazard, but it could ruin your building where it might not just be a couple dollars.  Now it could be a couple thousand dollars.  So I’m more concerned about your- your building’s well-being.  So do you think maybe within the next couple days I could see you come over for uhm.. the leak?", I have a lot of other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours.
3, 00:01:17," I really do understand but at this point I really need you to take care of this, and if you can’t take care of it in a- a- quick manner, I think that I’m gonna hafta withhold my rent."," I have a list and you’re on the list, but there are other problems that are more serious."
4, 00:01:44," I-- once again, I really do understand what you’re saying, but it may not be a severe uhm.. issue in your mind, but to me it is, ‘cause there’s a hole in my home where I’m paying rent.  Like I said, I can either withhold rent and if you-- if uh.. if need be, I’m also okay calling my lawyer.  But uhm.. I would prefer not to go that way, but if I have to, I will do so. <pauses> Miss Jones, are you still there?", <laughs> Yes.  It doesn’t sound that bad the last time you called.
5, 00:02:26," Well, it- it really wasn’t then, but now it is.  Uhm.. the weather’s been pretty bad outside as you do know, so uhm.. maybe you should come look at it before you decide if it’s bad or good.  Or maybe you could have one of your maintenance men come since you’re so busy.", Okay.  Uhm.. I can go take a look at it.  It might take a few days though.
6, 00:02:59,wer: You’re welcome.  Bye-bye., Okay.  All right.
