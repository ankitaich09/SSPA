1, 00:00:14,"  Yes, hi.  Uh.. this is Patient uh.. your renter.  I was calling about the water leak that I spoke to you about uhm.. last week, it still hasn't got fixed and uhm.. it's becoming to get much worse than it already is and I know there's gonna be a lot more damage and costly repairs if ya'll don't fix it as soon as possible.  So I'm trying to get an understanding on what's taking so long.","  Mm-hmm.  Uh.. well I'm sorry I haven't had enough time to get over to fix, I've been very busy."
2, 00:00:46,  Hello?,  Hi.  I'm still here.  Uhm.. I don't know what I can do about your problem right now though.
3, 00:01:27,"  Well I mean a part of the agreement on the lease and everything uh.. like that was that you're gonna maintain things such as water leaks and repairs that need to be done to the house, it's a part of our agreement, so I need you to come down here as soon as possible meaning in the next couple of days and fix this water leak or I'm just gonna have to call someone and get it fixed myself and send you the bills. <inaudible 00:02:00> you do not have nothing else to say?",  It's just that I have a lot of other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours right now.
4, 00:02:11,"  Okay, that's fine, I understand that.  And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take further action and this situated, I will make a report to the Better Housing Bureau about what's going on and I'm gonna fix my repairs myself and I'm gonna send you the bill.  So when it comes down to paying rent, I'm not gonna pay it until you either reimburse me for fixing the leak or you fix the leak yourself especially since you're not willing to answer none of my questions or seem like you even care about getting", 
5, 00:02:41, ,"  Okay.  Well thanks for giving me a call about the problem.  Uhm.. like I said, I don't- don't know what I can do about it right now, but thank you for giving me a call. Good bye."
