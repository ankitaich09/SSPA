2, 00:00:21,"  Good.  I'm calling regarding the leak I spoke to you about a few days ago and you had mentioned when I spoke with you that you were gonna try to come over within the next day or two and-- but I never heard anything back, so I was just calling to check the status of that to find out when you'll be able to take a look at that leak, to have it re- repaired.","  Yes, thank you for calling.  I apologize that I haven't been over to fix it, I've just been so busy."
3, 00:00:50,"  Okay uhm.. well do you know when you'll be able to come over and take a look at the leak because it's very-- it's getting worse.  Yeah, I'm noticing more damage in the ceiling.",  Is it?
4, 00:01:00,"  My thing is I'm afraid that it's gonna spread and get even worse, I'm just afraid that the building could cave in over time, so I just wanna minimize the damage, the damage to the property.",  Okay.
5, 00:01:10,  So do you have a date and time that we could maybe set up a time to- for you come out and take a look at it To fix it?,"  Yeah.  So before we uhm.. do timeline-- so just to make sure I have the status correct, it didn't sound that bad the last time that you called, so can you tell me more about it?"

But since then, you know, we've had a- you know, a few says of rain and now I notice that same little leak is spreading.  I have a <inaudible 00:01:45> almost the size of maybe about two of those, what do you call those type of _________ 00:01:51, those recessed lighting, it's gotten in the side of two of those.  Because at first it was maybe the size of a flashlight, it wasn't even that big at first, but now it's", 
7, 00:01:58, ,  Okay.
8, 00:02:11,"  So I didn't know if you were gonna be able to come over today to take a look at it 'cause like with that rain I don't-- it's not gonna get any better, but I'm just afraid, you know, with my furniture, the damage to the property, you know, my TV is right underneath it.  I'm just afraid it's gonna cause more damage, you know, to my property inside the- the apartment.","  Right, right, yeah."
9, 00:02:33,"wer:  Yeah, yes, so those are all good questions.","  Yeah, so I uhm.. I do have a list, I have you on my list  uhm.. there's just been, you know, a bunch of other problems too that are have been more serious and I actually do all the repairs myself for the whole building.  Uhm.. so I'm thinking that honestly it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I'll have time to fix it."
10, 00:03:21,"  Okay, uhm.. that's not-- to me that's not acceptable at all especially for water damage in anâ€¦",
