1, 00:00:14," Hi, Interviewer. This is Patient calling from Apartment 101. How are you?", I’m all right. Thank you.
2, 00:00:22," Uhm.. I-- look, I- I called you probably about a couple of days ago and I know you said you were gonna come by uhm.. because of that leak that was happening in- in the top of the ceiling. I guess maybe the- the tenant from above has a leak or- or something, but it’s kinda dripping down. Uhm.. I- I know that you were supposed to come by. Do you know what day more or less I can expect you?"," Mm-hmm. It might take me about a week, maybe two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
3, 00:00:50," Oh no. Okay. Is there anything that you can recommend that I can do? Because I hate-- I hate for it to get worse. I mean, it’s already gotten worse since the first phone call. It’s- it’s kind of like a, you know, a good size leak and I’m- I’m really afraid it’s gonna ruin the apart- the apartment and, you know, to save us both money, I-- you know, I’m trying to figure out a way to fix it somehow. Do you have any other options, anybody that you know I can speak to- to get this fixed?"," Uhm.. well, so, what have you done about the problem so far?"
4, 00:01:26," So far, all I did was just call you. I- I didn’t want to make any adjustments, only because, you know, I didn’t want to be, you know, charged for something had I did taken it to- to you know, my own, uhm.. hands and- and I know in- in the lease agreement that we have, it- it says that you are gonna be responsible for all that. So, I just didn’t wanna, you know, step on anybody’s toes. Uhm.. so, I haven’t really done anything about it other than call you. So, I don’t know if there is something that I- I can do, I- I can most definitely look into", 
5, 00:01:57, ," Mm-hmm. You don’t need to uh.. look into that. I’m aware of the problem. So, I’ll be over as soon as I can."
6, 00:02:16,"wer: Yeah. Like I said, it might..."," Mm-hmm. It might take about a week, maybe two weeks before I’ll have time to get over."
7, 00:02:29," Okay. Uhm.. okay, well, is there anything that meanwhile, I can, you know, do you want me to put some towels somewhere? I mean, I’m- I’m gonna do that anyway just to kinda cover some of my stuff. So, uhm.. I have like a bucket right now to kinda cover the- the leak, but uhm.. you know, I guess if it- if it gets any worse, I’ll- I’ll give you a call, uhm.. is there anything else that you want me to do meanwhile?"," Uhm.. no, I’m not sure what else we can do about the problem right now."
8, 00:02:59," Okay. Uhm.. well, I’ll look into it some more and then uhm.. I’ll get with a couple of friends and see if there’s something that we can do uhm.. and then I’ll call you and just, you know, see if that’s-- you’d give me the go ahead or the green light to do it if I’d come up with anything productive. Uhm.. but I appreciate it. Thank you. I hope to see you soon uhm.. and I guess we’ll touch base in a couple of days whenever you swing by.", Okay. Yeah. Thanks for calling.
9, 00:03:25, Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye.,
