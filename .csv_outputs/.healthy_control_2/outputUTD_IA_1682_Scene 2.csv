1, 00:00:25," Hi, Interviewer. This is uhm.. this is uhm... Should- should I say my name?", Sure. That’s fine. Yeah.
2, 00:01:07," Okay. Uhm.. this-- this is Patient. I- I was uhm.. calling about the uhm.. actually, we spoke a few days ago, I had about the slow leak in the ceiling and it’s really uhm.. became much worse and uhm.. was trying to wait about and kinda <inaudible 00:00:39>. We really uhm.. need someone to address this because the problem is uh.. uhm.. causing much more damage. Do you- do you have an idea when uhm.. maybe we get someone to fix it? It’s really an emergency."," Yeah. Yeah. That’s uhm.. I understand. So, uhm.. I’ve just got a lot of tenants right now with problems that are more serious, but I have a list and you are on the list."
3, 00:01:41," Oh, I see. Uhm.. and if you’d know me, I don’t- I don’t want to get hostile or anything, but do- do-- if I could just-- just respectfully, can you tell me uhm.. how- how bad does it need to get for it to uhm.. for someone to, you know, to be able to fix it? Because I’m just worried about uhm.. you know, I have children here. I worried about them uhm.. getting harmed and myself, uhm.. just how much damage it <inaudible 00:01:32>."," Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, totally. Uhm.. it didn’t sound that bad the last time you called. Did something change?"

Uhm.. and you know, I’m not able to officially, you know, since it’s supposed to be something that uhm.. you handle since you’re the landlord uhm.. and with the- the amount of time, it’s gonna just cause much more damage, which will add to your- your list of problems with it on it. So, I just-- if you could really give me a timetable of uh.. when you can address this."," Yeah, of course. Uhm.. so, I’m thinking that it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
5, 00:02:33, And what are- what are your suggestions for what I should do in the meantime?," Uhm.. well, what- what have you done so far? And then I can maybe give some suggestions."
6, 00:03:06," Uhm.. just tried to uhm.. plug the- the hole uh.. where the leak was coming from. Uhm.. and you know, get the-- not to try to limit the-- my use of the-- that’s causing the leak, but I don’t-- I- I’m sure that it will-- it’ll be much worse and then like- like I said, they-- I- I’m thinking about the- the-- what it may do for uh.. the other apartments surrounding. So, it’s gonna be-- like for the apartment building in general, it’s",
