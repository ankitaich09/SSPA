0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:13," Hi, Interviewer. I’m calling about the leak I talked to you uhm.. recently. I was just wondering uhm.. when you’re planning on coming over to fix it. I know we talked recently about uhm.. you coming over in the next few days, but I never got any sort of response. So, I’m just wondering how it’s going so far."," Oh, yes. Hi."
2, 00:00:37," Hi. Uhm.. this is Patient, your tenant. Uhm.. I spoke to you last few days about coming over to fix the leak. I was wondering if you’d gotten around to it or had been planning to. Do you remember when we talked uhm.. recently about the leak that was happening in my apartment? If not, I can tell you what’s been going on?"," Uhm.. yes, I do remember. Uhm.. I-- tell me where it’s at now. So, what- what’s going on? What have you done so far?"
3, 00:01:18," Right. So, it started sort of in the corner of my bedroom, but it’s sort of started to grow and now, it’s really like starting to drip. I moved some of my furniture around, stuck with a bucket to catch the water, but it just seems to be getting worse.", Okay.
4, 00:01:40," Yeah. So, I don’t see how the issue’s gonna get solved with it just dripping because I keep having to empty out the bucket every time it fills up and it looks like it just keeps growing. Is there any way we could maybe call someone to look at it or see how we could get it fixed?"," Yes. Yeah. So, I have a list. Uhm.. you are on the list. Uhm.. I just have a couple other problems that are ahead of yours right now."
5, 00:02:09," Oh, uhm.. what other problems are those?"," Uhm.. just with other tenants, just some-- a couple more problems that are just a little bit more serious right now."
6, 00:02:20," Oh, okay. So, when do you think that you’ll be able to get to mine on the list?"," Uhm.. I’m thinking that it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
7, 00:02:34," Oh, okay. Uhm.. that’s-- a week or two weeks, I’m worried that it’ll just become even bigger issue and it’s also difficult for me to live as it is right now just because my environment is very uhm.. wet and it feels like my- my furniture and clothes is gonna start getting moldy. Is there any way you can maybe call someone else to help fix it so that you don’t have to trouble yourself to come over?"," Yeah. That’s a good idea. Uhm.. I actually do all the repairs myself for the entire building, though."
8, 00:03:10," Oh, wow. Uhm.. is there any way you would consider maybe hiring someone else or uhm.. getting someone you know to come look at it?"," Uhm.. I don’t know. Let me-- I’m actually with another tenant right now, but uhm.. thank you for calling me again. I am aware of the problem uhm.. and I will be over as soon as I can, okay?"
9, 00:03:39, Bye., Okay. Bye-bye.
