0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:14," Interviewer, this is Patient calling from Apartment 212. How are you today?", I’m all right. Thanks.
2, 00:00:24," Oh, that’s good. I’m calling you back because I had had a conversation with you about the slow leak in my ceiling and it’s becoming quite a concern now because the leak has gotten a little worse and it’s starting to do damage in the apartment. Can you please let me know when you’ll be able to come by and fix that?"," Uhm.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
3, 00:00:55," Yeah. Well, I really appreciate that you have a busy schedule, but I do as well. Here’s my concern-- the leak is not only damaging my furniture at this point, it’s starting to leave a large welt in the ceiling and I’m afraid that we might have a collapse in a very short time unless it’s fixed right away. Do you think you might be able to come over and take a look at it, at least? Then we can discuss the next steps.", Uhm.. I’m not sure. It’s just that I have a lot of other tenants right now with problems that are ahead of yours.
4, 00:01:35," No, I appreciate that. Uhm.. but I’m willing to make a compromise. I’d be happy to call a plumber on my own, have him come over to take a look at it, and then I can give you the amount that he would charge to have it fixed if that would be okay with you."," Uhm.. that’s a good idea, but it’s just that I usually do all the repairs myself for the whole building. So, I’m not sure that it would work."
5, 00:02:05," Uhm.. again, I appreciate that you are so busy. Uhm.. we all are these days. But I’m going to have to make a call to someone to repair this. As I mentioned, it’s causing damage to the apartment and I know you must be concerned with that. What-", 
6, 00:02:32, , Mm-hmm.
7, 00:02:49, May I send you a picture of what the ceiling looks like so you can get an idea of what my concern is?," Uhm.. you can send the picture. It’s just that I don’t know exactly what I can do about the problem right now. Uhm.. like I said, it might take a week or maybe two before I’ll have time to get over to fix it. Uh..."
8, 00:03:13," Okay. Uhm.. yeah, I can-- I really can’t wait that long. What I’ll do then is I will go ahead and call another plumber if you cannot come over and fix it and then I can deduct the cost of the plumber from the cost of my-- from my rent uh.. payment to you for next month. That’s the best I can do."," Oh, you don’t need to call someone. Uhm.. I’m aware of the problem. So, I’ll be over as soon as I can get to it. I do have to run now, but thank you for giving me a call about the problem."
9, 00:03:53," Okay. Well, I’ll be calling you back tomorrow morning to re-address this again. In fact, if you aren’t willing to come, then I’m going to go ahead and make the proper steps that I need to make to solve this problem. I hope you understand that."," Okay. Yeah. I-- it’s just that I have to go now, but like I said, thanks for uhm.. telling me some more about the problem."
10, 00:04:18, Okay. I’ll call you in the morning., All right. Bye-bye.
