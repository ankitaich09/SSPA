0, 00:00:16, Hi there. How are you doing today? I noticed you just moved in. Welcome to the neighborhood., 
1, 00:00:26," Oh, it’s pretty nice, very quiet. Uh.. there’s no-- there’s not much around it, but it’s a pretty nice neighborhood to live in.", 
2, 00:00:39, Uhm.. <laughter> I don't know what to say. So what made you move here? Where are from-- coming from?, 
3, 00:00:55, Oh really? What type of work uh.. do you do? If you don't mind me asking., 
4, 00:01:02," Oh, that sounds pretty nice. Okay. Well, if you need anything, I’ll be around. And maybe we can always take a drink or come by and visit.", 
5, 00:01:25," Uhm.. pretty nice guy. He’s- he’s a little bit strict, but uhm.. in terms of policies. But I think that’s just to keep every- everyone safe, everyone happy. So-- but other than that, he’s pretty good and everything, I guess. I don't know what to say.", 
6, 00:01:59," Oh yes. Like I said, this neighborhood is pretty calm. There’s really not much happening. And then we have the police patrol at night that goes around, so that’s pretty good. I need anything, they-- they’re pretty-- they always are there. And the office is-- has a 24/7 line if anything-- you need anything. But yeah, everything else is pretty quiet, pretty calm, pretty safe. There’s a park, if you cross the street. So", 
7, 00:02:29, So it’s just moving here? With-- any other family members with you?, 
8, 00:02:45, Yeah? Okay. That’s good. Well <laughter> <inaudible 00:02:58>., 
9, 00:03:05, You’re welcome. I’ll see you <overlapping conversation>.,
