0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:14," Yes, this is she.", Uhm.. was there something I could help...
2, 00:00:19," Yes, sir, I- I was calling, uh.. well, you're- you're calling me because I have called you several times on several occasions about the leak that's in the ceiling.  Now the leak is getting worser and I need someone to come over as soon as possible.  Do you know when anyone can make it out here?  It-- because I'm-- because it's really becoming an inconvenience for", 
3, 00:00:52, ," Uhm.. well it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I'll have time to fix it."
4, 00:01:11," Okay, sir, I understand that, but we-- I've been dealing with you for the past week about this situation and now it's getting to a point where it's getting beyond unrepairable because it's damaging my things in my apartment and it's really inconvenient for me because of what's going on with the situation.  So do you know when you'll have someone out here?", It still might take me about a week or two weeks before I'll be able to get over to fix it.
5, 00:01:49," Okay, sir, that is not acceptable, but what I can suggest is that I can get someone to come in, take care of the situation and you can just reimburse me for it, because it's taking you too long to come here and I'm having all kind of problems with this and I've been waiting too long for you to come.  So do you think that's a solution where I can get someone to come out and I'll pay them and then you can go ahead and reimburse me or just take it off my rent?"," Well, that's a good idea but I do all the repairs myself for the whole building so I'm not sure it would work."
6, 00:02:32," I can understand that, sir, but still uh.. this problem has been going on too, far too long so I need for you to either come up with a solution or I can do what I just said that I can do to uh.. get it taken care of.  And you can just reimburse me or you can just take it out of next month's rent."," Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what I can do about the problem right now, uhm.. thanks for giving me a call about it but I need to run right now."
7, 00:03:19," Okay, sir, but if you could get back with me as soon as possible, please."," I'll try and get back when I can, uhm.. but like I said, I just don't know what I can do about the problem right now.  Uhm.. but thanks for giving me a call."
8, 00:03:35, Thank you.,
