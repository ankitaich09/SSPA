0,00:00:00, ," Hi.  This is uh.. Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:14," Yes.  Well, uhm.. I was calling you b-- uh.. because uh.. I called you a few days back about the leak in my ceiling, and I would like to know uh.. when will you be able to come over to fix it?  The leak has now gotten much worse and is damaging uh.. proper--"," Okay.  Uhm.. well, I don’t know what I can do about your problem right now."
2, 00:00:36," Well, I really need to get it fixed because it’s really uhm.. damaging my furniture and it’s just damaging the property.  Like, the leak has gotten much bigger than it was a few days back when I called you the first time.", Okay.  I have a lot- a lot of other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours.
3, 00:00:58," Well, I really need to uh.. find a solution for this because I cannot stay uh.. with a ceiling like that for much longer.  If anything, that’s gonna fall off. <laughs>", All right.  Uhm.. I do all the repairs myself for the whole building.
4, 00:01:21, Uhm.. do you have anybody else that you think can come over?  Or maybe I can bring someone over to fix it and then we can discuss about the payment.," Uhm.. I’m sorry I haven’t had enough time to get over to fix it, but I’ve been very busy."
5, 00:01:39," Yes, I understand, but like I said, it’s uhm.. it’s- it’s risking my children and just the apartment itself is just collapsing in the ceiling, and with the raining days, it’s just getting worse.", It didn’t sound that bad the last time you called.
6, 00:02:01," Yes.  Like I said, it has gotten uh.. much worse these days, and that’s why I- I’m calling you, because I don’t want it to get any worse than what it is right now."," I have a list and you’re on the list, but there are other problems that are more serious."
7, 00:02:31," Well, I think we need to come up with uh.. an agreement, because like I said, it’s gonna-- it stay like that much uh.. longer.  I think it’s pretty serious the fact I’m putting my childrens at risk."," It might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
8, 00:02:56," Wow.  I really need it to be fixed a little bit uh.. much faster.  You told me that you were gonna be coming the next day or- or two, and...", All right.  I’m aware of the problem and I’ll be over as soon as I can to fix it.
9, 00:03:21," Well, uh.. how soon do you think that will be?", Uhm.. I could come over right now.
10, 00:03:28, Okay.  Thank you., Okay.  Bye.
