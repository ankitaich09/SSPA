0,00:00:00, ,"  Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:16,"  Hello, Interviewer.  This is Patient  00:00:18.  I called you last week and left you a message about the slow leak in my ceiling.  I still haven't gotten a call back from you yet sweetheart.  Could you tell me what the problem is?","  Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry I haven't had enough time to get over to fix it, I've been very busy."
2, 00:00:35,"  Okay, well why couldn't-- I called and left a message and everything, why couldn't you call me to leave me a message to let me know that- what was going on, so that I wouldn't, you know, keep on calling you bugging you?","  Mm-hmm.  Like I said, I'm sorry I didn't get back to you, it's just that I had a lot of other tenants with problems that were ahead of yours."
3, 00:00:57,"  Yes ma'am, I understand.  Now the uh.. leak in my ceiling it's- it has worsened a lot more and now I- I really, really need it to be fixed Interviewer and I don't know how long I'm supposed to be waiting to get this fixed, I've put work orders, you know, last week and last week it was just a little bitty leak and now on today there's this tremendous leak Interviewer, I don't know what we're gonna have to do about this problem sweetheart.", 
4, 00:01:33,  Do you know when you would have- when you would be able to have maintenance come out and even take a look at the leak?,"  It might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I'll have time to fix it."
5, 00:01:47,"  Oh wow.  Okay, so is there any kinda way you could give me somewhere like a voucher or something that I could move out and go to somewhere else until you're able to fix this or could you move me to a different residence of yours until you're able to get this fixed?  Because I mean <inaudible 00:02:03> stay in here with uh.. a leaky ceiling sweetheart.","  Mm-hmm.  That's a good idea, but I'm not sure I would be able to uhm.. take care of that right now."
6, 00:02:16,"  Okay.  Well uhm.. you think you could inquire with your supervisor and she could g- get something done about that maybe even a discount on the rent or I mean something because I mean we're staying inside of here with a leaking ceiling and we're getting wet, things are getting damaged that we're paying for and it's-- nothing else is getting done?  So uh.. do you think", 
7, 00:02:46, ,"  Mm-hmm.  Well I am not sure that we'll be able to make that work uhm.. and again I'm sorry that I haven't had enough time to get over to fix it, I'm just not sure what I can do about the problem right now.  Uhm.. I have to run right now though, but thank you for, you know, giving me a call again about it."
8, 00:03:18,"  Oh yeah, wait a minute Interviewer.  So Interviewer, could you please tell me if you know if someone's gonna come over in a week or two or, do you know for sure when someone's gonna try to come over because I don't wanna be sitting here and getting, you know, keep getting my things damaged and, you know?",  Mm-hmm.
9, 00:03:39,"  I mean Interviewer, your house probably is not getting leaked in, but mine did, so your things not getting damaged, but mines are?  And I know there's more- more bigger problems over here than mine, but I would rather someone come speak to me about the problem that I'm having instead of just leaving me inside of here with no- no luck, no hope, no nothing.",  Mm-hmm.  Well like I said it's might take a week or maybe two weeks before I'll have time to fix it still.  Uh.. but…
10, 00:04:10,"  Well okay Interviewer.  How about we can-- okay well uh.. can I not pay my rent until that's paid, until that's fixed?",  Uhm.. I…
11, 00:04:21,"  Because I may have to go out and find, I may have to go out and find someone to come and do this work for me, Interviewer because I'm not gonna be able to stay in here like this.","  Mm-hmm.  You don't need to call anybody else, uhm.. I'm aware of the problem, so I'll be over as soon as I can to fix it, I'm just not sure I can do anything about it right now.  But thank you again for giving me a call about it.  I do have to run right now."
