0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:13," Hi, Interviewer. Uh.. I- I appreciate you taking my call. Uhm.. I- I know I- I'd contacted you a while back uh.. about a leak in my roof but I- I- I hadn't gotten a response and then the- the leak appears to be getting worse so I just wanted to- to quickly follow up and see if there's anything that you could help me do to uh.. rectify the- the situation before it gets too much worse."," I'm sorry I haven't had enough time to get over to fix it, but I've been very busy."
2, 00:00:45," Oh, no, I- I- I completely understand. Uhm.. And- and it- it's really not a matter of- of me being upset about the situation, it's a matter of this- this is something that could affect the property itself and that is, if I'm being very honest, kind of a nuisance for me. Is there anything you can do or anyone that you could send over to look at the- -the situation and help- help me fix it? Uhm.. I'm- I'm of course willing to work around your schedule. I just, I do need to get this fixed."," Uh.. I do all the repairs myself for the whole building, so, I wouldn't be able to send someone."
3, 00:01:22, Okay. Do you have any availability to- to get this completed in the next week or two maybe?, I have a list and you're on the list but there are other problems that are more serious.
4, 00:01:39," I- I completely understand. I do want to make sure that you know, though, that the situation is starting to get quite a bit worse and I, again, this is uh.. not exclusively an issue with me and my conveniences. I don't want the property to be damaged any further and I uhm.. You know, obviously, I can't change your schedule. I can't-- I can't make you more available", 
5, 00:02:09, , It didn't sound that bad the last time you called.
6, 00:02:31," Yeah, yeah. And it, again, it is starting to get worse, the situation. It really wasn't that bad before. It- it wasn't that much of a priority before but it's just one of those things that happens in apartments where it's continuing to get worse. And I did at the very least want to bring that up and uh.. bring that to your attention so that you know the full gravity of the situation.", Okay. I'll try to be over there as soon as possible.
7, 00:02:59, Bye., All right. Thank you. Bye bye.
