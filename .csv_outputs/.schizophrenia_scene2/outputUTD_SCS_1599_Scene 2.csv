0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:11," Hi, this is Patient. Uhm.. I was actually calling because uh.. we still had that leak in the ceiling and I hadn’t heard anything back. So, needed to try to get that fixed before it starts ruining our stuff.", Yeah. I’m so sorry about that. Uhm.. I just haven’t had enough time to get over and fix it this week. I’ve just been really busy.
2, 00:00:35,"wer: Yeah. Uhm.. so, I actually uh.. do all the repairs myself for the whole building.", Uhm...
3, 00:00:52," Okay. Uhm.. I- I don't know if it helps you out, but I have experience. I actually used to be a carpenter, home builder. I mean, I-- if you want me to try to take a look at it, I can uh.. can do that and just let you know what materials we might need or whatever.", Yeah. Uhm.. that’s a great idea. Uh.. could you tell me a little bit about uhm.. like what you’ve done about the problem so far?
4, 00:01:18," Uh.. so far, I haven’t really done anything because I didn’t, you know, liability reasons or whatever I didn’t really want to like start messing with stuff and I was uh.. concerned about getting up there in case the dry wall or sheetrock started to come down or whatnot but uh.. yeah, I mean, all I’ve done was poke my hand up there and try to take a look to see where it’s coming from."," Gotcha. Uhm.. well, you know, I definitely uh.. you know, I have a list and you’re on the list. There are just other uhm.. problems that I have to take care of first."
5, 00:01:59," Okay. So, you-- do you know like a timeframe, how long it’s gonna take you to get through those before you can get to here?"," Yeah. Uhm.. you know, it might take me about a week, uh.. maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
6, 00:02:19," Okay. Uhm.. two- two weeks or it’s in-- yeah, that’s uh.. kinda frustrating. So, uhm.. what about in the event that uh.. my property starts to get damaged due to the- the leak not being taken care of?"," Mm-hmm. You know, uh.. it didn’t sound that bad the last time that you called."
7, 00:02:53," Okay. Well, it’s not getting any better, I can tell you that."," Well, I mean, you know, I definitely uhm.. you know, understand about your problem. I just have, you know, other- other tenants with problems that I have to take care of as well."
8, 00:03:11,"wer: Yeah. I- I definitely understand. Uhm.. so, you said uh..."," Oh, sorry."
9, 00:03:46," Like- like with the repairs that you’ve got, are they based on just the- the order that you call them in-- that are called in or like the priority level as far as like the potential of damage?"," Mm-hmm. Uhm.. yeah, so, like the- the seriousness of the- of the uhm.. issue is- is how they’re kind of ordered."
10, 00:04:06," Okay. Yeah. All right. That makes- that makes sense. Uhm.. okay. Well, I guess at this point uh.. there’s not a whole lot that I can do. Uhm.. so, I’ll just keep biding my time. I mean, I would appreciate it if you can kinda give me a head’s up, you know, week to week and let me know, you know, where I’m at on the list.", Okay. Yeah. I can-- uhm.. I can keep you updated on that.
11, 00:04:34, Okay.," All right. Well, I uhm.. I will try to be over uhm.. in the next week or uh.. the next two weeks to take a look at it."
