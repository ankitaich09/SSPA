1, 00:00:13, Hi. How are you doing? Uhm.. I’ve been trying to get in touch with you. Uhm.. thanks for reaching back out. Uhm.. I have a leak and uhm.. it’s gotten worse., Yeah. I’m so sorry. Uhm.. I just haven’t had a ti- enough time to get over and fix it yet. I’ve been really busy this week.
2, 00:00:36, I understand. Are you gonna send someone out as soon as possible?," Uhm.. well, uh.. I have a lot of other tenants uh.. with problems that are ahead of yours right now."
3, 00:00:51," So, what am- what am- what am I supposed to do? Leaks are considered emergency maintenance issues. So, uhm.. I don’t want my apartment floor to be flooded. So, I would appreciate it if you could find someone to come out as soon as possible, please."," Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Uhm.. I mean, I definitely-- I have a list and you’re on the list. Uhm.. there are just other problems that are more serious that I have to take care of first."
4, 00:01:27," Okay. Well, if it is not fixed pretty soon, I don’t want to be responsible for any damages that it does to the wood floors because of the leak.", Yeah. Yeah. I understand.
5, 00:01:42, I will take pictures.," Okay. Yeah. Uhm.. I mean, you know, it might take me about a week, uh.. maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
6, 00:01:55," Oh, uh.. okay. Well, I just wanted to notify you.", Okay. Yeah.
7, 00:02:05," And stuff. There’s nothing you can really do about it but put some stuff down and hope it don’t get all over the place, keep mopping it up.", Yeah. Uhm.. could you tell me a little bit about what you’ve done about the problem so far?
8, 00:02:32," Uhm.. yes, I’ve mopped it up. I’ve put uhm.. things down to absorb the water. Uhm.. I’m mopping it up as soon as possible. A bucket-- I’m emptying it into the toilet when it fills up with water just to keep it from saturating on the wood floors and doing the best I can to just keep it dry."," Okay. Yeah. Uhm.. yeah, I mean, like I said, uhm.. you know, I just have a lot of people uh.. on the list. So, it might take me about a week, uh.. maybe even two before I’ll have time to fix it."
9, 00:03:13, Okay., All right. Is there uh.. anything else I can help you with?
10, 00:03:22, Okay. Thank you.," All right. Well, uhm.. thank you for calling and I’ll uhm.. be over uh.. in about a week or two to take care of it."
