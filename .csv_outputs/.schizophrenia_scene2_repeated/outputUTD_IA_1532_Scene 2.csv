0,00:00:00, ," Hello, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:12," Hi, uhm.. this is Patient in apartment number two. Uhm.. I called you about a week ago about a leak in my ceiling. Uhm.. you said you would be right over. You never came over. The leak has persistently got worse. The roof is showing signs of water damage and uhm.. either y’all can fix it or I guess I will take y’all to court to get it fixed or move."," Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry that I haven’t been able to get over there to fix it. I’ve been so busy."
2, 00:00:44," I- I mean, I understand being busy, but you could send somebody else or whatever you need to do because my stuff’s having to be put off and moved around. I mean, that room is pretty much not visible. I don't know if mold’s growing, uhm.. but there’s a- a pretty bad drip from the ceiling now and it’s not uhm.. livable."," Oh, wow. Okay. It didn’t sound that bad the last time that you called."
3, 00:01:18," It’s gotten worse. I mean, when you said you were gonna be over the next day, it wasn’t much of an issue to me back then. But I mean, we’re a week down the road now. I don't know if maybe the upstairs apartment is leaking worse. So, it’s causing my leak to be worse.", Okay.
4, 00:01:35," Or what’s going on, but it- it really needs fixed.", Okay. Yeah. I completely understand.
5, 00:01:42," So, I’m just wondering when should I expect somebody?"," Uhm.. yeah. Well, I- I am aware of the problem. So, I’ll be over as soon as I can. Uhm.. I do all the repairs myself for the whole building. So, uhm.. I’ve just a couple things to get done beforehand."
6, 00:02:05," Well, I’m-- uhm.. today, tomorrow..."," Uh.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks."
7, 00:02:16," Yeah. That- that’s not gonna work. That’s- that’s not gonna work. There’s no way that’s gonna work. By then, I’ll be gone. I promise you that.", Okay.
8, 00:02:28," The roof is going to fall in. It is leaking bad. Uhm.. I’m- I’m not gonna deal with it. If I need to, I’ll go straight through to the health instruct-- uh.. the- the health informer and let him know about the problem with this building or you could just pay some money to come over and do it real quick."," Okay. Yeah. No, that’s okay. So, yeah, you don’t need to call anyone. Uhm.. I’ll- I’ll be over as soon as I can. Uh.. like, I’m on my way."
9, 00:03:00, Bye., Okay. Bye-bye.
