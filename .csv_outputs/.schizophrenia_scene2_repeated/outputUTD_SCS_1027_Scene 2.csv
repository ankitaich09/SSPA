0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:09," Hi, Interviewer. I have a leak that I called you about last week and I seen that oh, it’s getting worser."," Yeah. I’m so sorry. Uhm.. I haven’t had enough time to get over and fix it yet. I’ve just been really, really busy."
2, 00:00:22," Oh, Interviewer, that’s costing me in time and expenses because the water is leaking so much to where it’s destroying most of my property that I have in the area."," Oh, wow. Uhm.. it didn’t sound that bad the last time you called."
3, 00:00:37," Well, yes, it- it wasn’t until now, since you have let it linger so long, now, I-- it’s getting worser and I need you to come as soon as possible."," Yeah. Uhm.. you know, I just have a lot of other tenants uhm.. with problems that are ahead of yours right now."
4, 00:00:52," But Interviewer, this is very crucial. This is the reason why I’m calling you back the second time because now, my property and my time is wasted in this situation."," Yeah. You know, I’m sorry. It just-- uhm.. like I said, I have a list and you’re on the list, uhm.. but there are just other problems I have to take care of first."
5, 00:01:11," Do you know how long it will be before you get to me, Interviewer?"," Yeah. Uhm.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
6, 00:01:19," But Interviewer, I have waited a week already. So, how much longer will it be?"," Yeah. Like I said, you know, about a week, uh.. maybe even two before I’ll be able to get over there and fix it."
7, 00:01:30," Okay, Interviewer. Let’s do this right here. I have a solution-- what if I pay someone to come and fix it and then you just reimburse me for the services?"," You know, that’s a good idea, but I actually do all the repairs myself for the whole building."
8, 00:01:43," Okay. That’s understandable, Interviewer, but I’m in a tough spot right now. So, if you could, I could get someone to come out here and get it fixed or you can just go ahead and take it off my month-- my next month’s rent."," Yeah. I mean, uhm.. we can definitely, you know, work something out about the rent. Uhm.. can you tell me a little bit about what you’ve done about the problem so far?"
9, 00:02:05," Uh.. so far, I have, like I said, it has cost me in expenses. I have moved things out of my room. I have put down paper. I have put down-- I even had a- a vacuum wet vac to try to get the water up in order for nothing else to get destroyed. So, this is really crucial- crucial now, Interviewer. So, are you willing to work with me with the solution that I have given you?"," Uhm.. I mean, uhm.. excuse me, like I said, I do all the repairs myself for the whole building, uhm.. but I’ll try to come take a look uh.. in about a week or so to look at the problem."
10, 00:02:40," Okay, Interviewer, but that’s a little bit too long for me. I’ve already, like I said, waited a whole week for you to come. So, I feel as though that would be the best solution for me and you. I understand you do your own repairs, but you can just take this one time in consideration due to the consequences of the situation."," I-- yeah, I totally understand. Uhm.. you know, I just have a lot of other people on the list uhm.. that I have to take care of."
11, 00:03:09," Well, if you think about this, Interviewer, I’d be one less person you have to worry about if you-- uh.. we can go ahead and work out this prob-- this solution that I have given you.", Uhm.. and what solution...
12, 00:03:20," Well, for me to get someone to come and get it fixed and then you can take it off next month’s rent."," Uhm.. so, uh.. like I said, I do the repairs myself, uhm.. but we can definitely uh.. do something about the- the rent uhm.. if I’m not able to, you know, come fix it. Uhm.. but like I said, it’ll probably be about a- a week or so before I’ll be over there."
13, 00:03:41," Okay, Interviewer. But you’re still putting me in a tough spot. So, just give me a call back within a week and I can get someone to get an estimate on it and then if you’d like, I can give it to you or you can just come out and decide to do what you want to do with the situation.", Okay. That sounds good. I’ll uhm.. see you or talk to you in about a week or so.
14, 00:04:02," Okay. Thank you, Interviewer.", Thank you.
