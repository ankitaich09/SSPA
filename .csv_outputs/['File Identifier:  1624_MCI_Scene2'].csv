0,00:00:00, ,"  Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:15,  Hi Interviewer.  This is Patient calling.  I'm in apartment 4G.  I don't remember if you uhm.. remember my calling you last week to tell you about the leak I had in my ceiling.  Do you remember my call?,"  Yes, I do."
2, 00:00:33,  Okay.  Well at the time when we talked you said you would be over in the next day or so and you also said you would take care of it.  I haven't heard from you and I haven't seen you and I'm getting a little concerned because now that leak has gotten much worse.  Uhm.. is there a time or- that you can give me when to expect you to come and fix the problem?,"  Yeah uhm.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I'll have time to fix it."
3, 00:01:07,"  Well, that's unfortunate because as I mentioned before, it is getting worse, uhm.. I already have some damage in my apartment for which I don't wanna be held responsible.  I don't know what else to do.  What can you recommend as a quick fix until you do have time to come over here?  I'm willing to meet you any time, any day uhm.. you know, just tell me what we can do to resolve this before it gets to be an even bigger problem.  I know you're real busy, I understand that.  Uhm.. don't know if", 
4, 00:01:41, ,  Yeah.  I understand.
5, 00:01:55,"  What can we-- uhm.. can you at least come over like for five minutes and look at it real quick?  Maybe it's a quick fix uhm.. if you just, you know, give it a quick look, it may not be as bad as- as it looks, it just looks bad.  But if you could come over just real quick and look at it and maybe it is really bad and that'll make you uh.. adjust your work schedule and put this as a priority.  But it would really make me feel better if", 
6, 00:02:24, ,"  Yeah, that's a good idea uhm.. but I'm sorry, I just have a lot of other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours right now."
7, 00:02:40,"  I understand this is a big apartment building, I understand that, I know, you know, you're working by yourself.  Uh.. it would be nice if they could hire another maintenance person uhm.. to help, but it would really help my stress level if you could just pop in here real quick and look at it.  And again, it may be something real simple that you can take care of like in ten minutes or if it's such a severe problem, you- you're gonna bump it to the head of the list.  'Cause that would", 
8, 00:03:11, ,  Yeah.
9, 00:03:30,"  But no, I'm- I'm willing to meet you any time, you know, in the evenings or the weekend.  Uhm.. again I know you're busy, I know that, I see you running around taking care of a lot of these issues.  Uhm, I'm not asking for special…","  Yeah, I appreciate…"
10, 00:03:44,"  …uh.. treatment, I just would like at least, you know, look at it.","  Yeah, I appreciate your…"
11, 00:03:51,"  What do you think, do you think you can do that?","  Yeah, I appreciate your call, I just, I don't know what I can do about your problem right now uhm.. but I'll touch base with you, you know, uhm.. but I actually have to go right now, okay?"
12, 00:04:07,"  Is there any other person I can talk to to help resolve this problem?  I mean do you have another individual that can, you know, kind of fill in for you while you're so busy?",  Uhm…
13, 00:04:20,"  I just have this feeling that if we don't correct this situation, it's gonna get worse and it's gonna involve more time and effort and work on your part uhm.. to take care of it.  That's my only concern.","  Yeah, yeah."
14, 00:04:36,"  Uhm.. what can- what can we do together to resolve this?  Again, just a quick peek-a-boo on your part, you know, in my apartment to look at it would be helpful.  Maybe on your way home you can stop here and look at it or the start of the day, come by and look at it.  <inaudible 00:04:52> toolbox just to look at it.","  Yeah uhm.. it's still- it's still gonna be about a week or two weeks and I'm sorry to cut you off, but I've actually really gotta run right now uhm.. but we'll talk soon, okay?"
15, 00:05:04,  Bye.,"  Okay, bye-bye."
