0,00:00:00, ,"  Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlord."
1, 00:00:14,"  Yeah, Interviewer uh.. I called you the other day or I left a message uh..... about a leak that I'm having in my apartment coming in from the uh.. top floor and uhm.. it's starting to get a little worse than it was yesterday and it's very possible that uh.. you may have uh.. missed the uh.. message or someone failed to pass it on.  But it is getting worse and uh.. it's starting to uh.. to drip little by little,", 
2, 00:00:49, ,"  Uhm.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I'll have time to fix it."
3, 00:01:28,"  Uh.. you realize that the- that the rate that the water is starting to- to leak and it may be much worse obviously in the next day or so, so uh.. is there any uh.. precautions that uh.. could be put in place to uh.. to uh.. to help out until then or- or what?",  So what have you done about the problem so far?
4, 00:01:58,"  Uh.. like I said, I've uh.. it's coming up- it's coming from the- the top, obviously it's the top floor uh.. and like I said, I put a uh.. pail underneath and I may have to get a bigger pail depending on how more severe the water begins to leak some more. And then of course that's uh.. gonna start", 
5, 00:02:25, ,  Uhm.. well it didn't sound that bad the last time you called.
6, 00:02:45,"  Well uh.. like- like I said, at the time it was just a water spot, but now it's starting to drip, so-- I mean it's not a false ceiling so it's uh.. someone would have to go up into the uh.. floor space up there to see what's going on.",  Uhm.. well it'll still be about a week or two weeks before I'll have time to fix it.
7, 00:03:18,"  There i-- will I be able to-- I'm gonna probably have to get an uh.. probably get someone to stay with uh.. until then.  Would I be able to get compensate or, you know, my- with my uhm.. rent this pa- next month be prorated for the period of time I'm not living in the apartment?",
