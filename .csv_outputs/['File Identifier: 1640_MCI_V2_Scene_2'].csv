0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlord."
1, 00:00:11," Interviewer, good afternoon. This is Patient. Uh.. do you remember me?", Yes.
2, 00:00:18," Okay, Interviewer, the reason that I’m calling is about two weeks ago, I called you for my leak that I have in my house and you told me that the next day, you were coming and uh.. and I have not seen anything. Now, when- when do I expect you to come here and fix this leak? It’s getting worse."," Well, it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
3, 00:00:44," Interviewer, this-- uh.. I- I’m sorry to say, it’s not acceptable because when I made the agreements with you, you said that you were going to be a great landlord that is going to help as much as possible. It’s a little disappointing. Uh.. do you think that maybe you have somebody else that can come and fix this for you?"," Well, uhm.. I do all the repairs myself for the whole building."
4, 00:01:12," Hmm. Well, let me ask you this question. Is- is-- if it will be possible if one of us, we do the fix and send you the bill, would you pay that bill?"," Uhm... that- that could be something that we could do, yeah."
5, 00:01:31," Okay. So, if I understand you, that is okay with you if I fix the leak and I send you that bill to you. Am I-- did I understand correctly?"," Uhm.. well, actually, you know, I- I-- like I said, I do the repairs myself for the whole building."
6, 00:01:51," Yeah. But it seems like you are getting busy, Interviewer and- and I really need that leak-- it’s getting a lot of problems. I already lost a radio and uh.. the furniture is getting bad. So, this is not working. If- if I cannot fix it over here and you have to wait two weeks to come over here, Interviewer, something has to be done. You tell me what you want to do. It needs to be fixed now. Interviewer?", Uhm.. what have you done about the problem so far?
7, 00:02:28," What am I doing to the problem? Putting buckets-- it goes in the bucket, and I wanna change the buckets. I-- that’s the only thing that I can do is the buckets, when it fill it, I- I cannot be able to sleep because thinking that the bucket is going to fill up and this is rainy season. So, it might <inaudible 00:02:45> that. So- so, I’m expecting you tomorrow to get it fixed because this really, really, really needs to change, Interviewer.", Uhm.. yeah. I’m- I’m aware of the problem and I’ll be over as soon as I can.
8, 00:03:02," Well, Interviewer, also, other things-- could you imagine the problems that we have healthy-wise and maybe I have to go to the doctor because that? Uh.. if I have to go to the doctor, Interviewer, I need to send you the bill to you."," Okay. Uhm.. well, I gotta go right now, but I-- like I said, I- I don’t know what I can do about your problem right now, but we’ll talk about it soon, okay?"
9, 00:03:29," No, Interviewer, you don’t have to go. You have to tell me when you’re going to be here. This is not acceptable. It’s not-- you are trying to avoid me on trying to answer. This has to be done. This is your house. You as the landlord has this commitment. Otherwise, I have to take uh.. go over there and maybe talk to my lawyer on talking to you about this."," Okay. Well, it will still be about a week or two weeks, but I’ll make sure I get it fixed. Okay?"
10, 00:04:00," Okay. He is going to talk to you tomorrow, Interviewer. Thank you.", Sounds good. Thank you.
