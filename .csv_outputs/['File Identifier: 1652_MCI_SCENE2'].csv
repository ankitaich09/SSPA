0,00:00:00, ," Hi. This is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:14," Hi, I’m Patient. Uhm.. I live in Apartment 101 and I called you about a leak in the ceiling and you told me you would get uh.. some- somebody out there to fix it for me. Well, uhm.. I haven’t heard back from you and the work hasn’t been done, see, in fact, it’s getting worse. I’m very concerned about not being taken care of here. I’m worried about damaging my apartment and my stuff getting wet.", Okay.
2, 00:00:50, What do you plan to do about it?," Uhm.. yeah. So, can you tell me what you’ve done about the problem so far?"
3, 00:01:01," Uh.. I moved my stuff away from where the drip is and I’ve called you and that’s why I’m calling you again. But no, I don’t think it’s my job to fix something that-- I’m- I’m just renting the place. It’s not my place. I don’t own it. I’m just renting it. I think you should be responsible in getting repairs made on the ceiling.", Right. Right.
4, 00:01:29," So, when do you think you can get somebody over here to fix it for me?"," Uhm.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
5, 00:01:41," Well, that’s uhm.. to me, it’s not acceptable because uh.. I’ve already called you once on this and you promised me that it’d be fixed in a couple days. So, I’d really like you to uh.. put aside the other jobs that you might have and get someone out here to fix this. Like I said, I don’t want it to damage my stuff and uhm.. I- I expect uh.. it repaired very soon because that’s part of the lease that I signed that repairs would be done promptly. So, uhm.. I really would appreciate you get the", 
6, 00:02:16, , Yeah. I- I understand.
7, 00:02:32," Yeah. If- if you have a leak in this place-- in my apartment, you may be having some other leaks from that second floor.", Mm-hmm.
8, 00:02:39," So, it probably would be worth your while to have it checked out and make sure it’s not occurring in other- other apartments on my floor."," Yeah. I have a list and you’re on the list, but there are other problems that are more serious."
9, 00:03:06," Well, uhm.. I think my problems pretty serious. I’ve got leaks in my apartment and I worry about mold and it’s also gonna affect your carpeting and your ceiling if you don’t get someone out there to fix it. It’s gonna get worse. So, if you’re-- it’d be smart for you to be proactive, repair your uh.. apartment and keep uh.. uhm.. your renter happy. Please get someone out here", 
10, 00:03:38, ," Yeah. I totally understand. That’s a great idea. Uhm.. I’m actually with another tenant right now. So, I have to run. But uhm.. I’ll call you back okay?"
11, 00:03:54, Yeah. Uh.. what time are you gonna call me back? I want to make sure that uh.. I’m there when you call to tell you where we’re at.,
