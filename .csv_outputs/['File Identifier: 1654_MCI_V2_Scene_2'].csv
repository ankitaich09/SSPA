1, 00:00:11, Hi. This is Patient. I live in 422. I think I called you a few days ago about a leak in my ceiling and I hadn’t heard back from you. Uh.. it’s still leaking and uhm.. I want to know what we should do about it.," So, what have you done about the problem so far?"
2, 00:00:32," Uh.. right now, all I’ve got is a bucket underneath it to catch it. I- I haven’t done anything as far as uh.. going up into the attack or uhm.. you know, trying to patch the ceiling or anything like that.", Okay.
3, 00:00:53, Have you-- have uh.. you got a plumber that we can call?," Uhm.. so, I do all the repairs myself for the whole building."
4, 00:01:03," Oh, okay. So, what do you think’s the problem?"," Well, uhm.. I uh.. so, I- I’m sorry. I just haven’t had enough time to get over to fix it, but I’ve been very busy."
5, 00:01:23," Okay. Is- is anybody else near me having the same problem? Like, are any- any of the neighboring apartments having leaks or is it just me?", Uhm.. I- I do have a lot of other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours.
6, 00:01:40," Oh, okay, but not necessarily a leak problem. Okay. Uhm.. any ideas on when you could do something or do you have any ideas of anything else I should do besides have a bucket there?"," Well, uhm.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
7, 00:02:02," Really? Oh, my gosh. Uhm.. I- I uh.. I don't know what other problems people have. Are they-- are you just gonna go down your list no matter if it’s more urgent or-- I mean, like if this gets worse, can I get moved to the top?", Uhm.. we- we might be able to work something out.
8, 00:02:30," So, if I uh.. right now, it- it’s getting steady-- you know, but if- if it gets worse, I’m afraid you’re liable to lose part of the ceiling.", Mm-hmm.
9, 00:02:45," So, uhm.. I have- I have to say uh.. I’m- I’m right on the ver-- wha-- so, what-- if I hire a plumber to fix this, what- what uh.. is there a problem with that?"," Well, uhm.. you don’t need to call anybody. I’m aware of the problem and I’ll be over as soon as I can, okay?"
10, 00:03:10, Okay.," Okay. Uhm.. well, thanks for calling and uh.. I’ll get to it as soon as I can."
11, 00:03:20,wer: Bye., All right.
