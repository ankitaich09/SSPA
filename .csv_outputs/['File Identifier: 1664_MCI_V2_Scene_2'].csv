1, 00:00:12," Hey, Interviewer. This is Patient in Apartment 222. Uh.. I know it was raining really hard this past week and uh.. I guess the rain came through, but uhm.. some of my-- there’s some spots on my ceiling- ceiling. So, I know the- the actually rain did come through. So, I just wanted to let you know so you can tell the uh.. ask the- the maintenance worker to take a look at it and as quickly as possible. Uhm.. that’s it. There we go."," Okay. Uhm.. so, what have you done about the problem so far?"
2, 00:00:44," Yeah. Uhm.. I just want to check back in because I told you about it last week-- I mean, earlier this week and I didn’t see anybody in there. Uh.. I didn’t see anybody in there. So, I don’t want things to be damaged for the building itself or for my, you know-- I don’t want the leak to come on my carpet or any of my furniture either. So, I do need your help to get this uh.. finished quickly, uh.. get this repaired quickly because it’s gonna be-- it’s gonna damage your building and it’s gonna damage something of mine also. So, I’d really appreciate if you please", 
3, 00:01:14,"wer: Yeah. Uhm.. so, it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it.", Okay.
4, 00:01:34," Okay. Well, uhm.. if it-- if there-- if the weather calls for more rain, I’m gonna have to use something, either press some plastic something or something over the thing because I don’t want my carpet ruined because of that leak. It is get-- it did get bad last week because of the rains and I don't wanna ruin any of my furniture or any of my carpet with the leaks. So, either help me with some kind of plastic or something like that because we do need to stop- do something about this quickly. It’s not- it’s not just gonna go away.", Okay.
5, 00:02:14, Sound good? Anything else?," Uhm.. well, it- it didn’t sound that bad last time you called."
6, 00:02:24," Well, uhm.. I just wanted to tell you about it last time because there was a brown spot in the ceiling and it wasn’t really bad, but as you see, there’s more rain and uh.. we-- that was one week ago and it’s still raining. So, we do need to do something about this because it’s gonna get worse and I think you-- we need to do something-- you need to do something about it quickly because it’s getting worse and there’s more rain in the weather-- in the weather forecast. So, it’s something that we do need to work on quickly."," Okay. Uhm.. well, it still might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it, but thanks for calling and I’ll get to it when I can."
7, 00:03:14," Okay. Uhm.. yeah, that’s interesting. Well, I do need to get some-- either some plastic or something like that uh.. to uh.. so, I’ll be incurring other expenses to try to solve this problem for you. So, uhm.. I do need a sense of urgency from you that it- it needs-- it does need to be fixed before another week, before it starts to rain even more, before the- the problem gets worse.", Okay. Yeah. That- that sounds like a good idea. Uhm.. we can go ahead and just end this...
