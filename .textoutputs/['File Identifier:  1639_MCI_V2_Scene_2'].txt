+++ 00:00:41  +++

+++ 00:03:15  +++
Interviewer:  Right.  Like I said I- I- I'm just busy, I don't know what I can do about your problem right now and it'll- it'll still be about a week or two weeks, but I'll- I'll be able to get to it.
+++ 00:03:42  +++
Patient:  What specifically is uh.. is holding you up, if you made me a promise a week ago, were you just putting me off?
Interviewer:  Well I gotta- I gotta go right now, can I give you a call back quickly?

Patient:  Bye.
