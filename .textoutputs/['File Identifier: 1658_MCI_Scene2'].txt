Interviewer: Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady.
+++ 00:00:13  +++
Patient: Hi, it-- yes, this is Patient in number 216. Uh.. I was wanting to see if I could talk to you about the leak that I called you about a few days ago. Uh.. do you remember me calling you about a slow leak in the ceiling?
Interviewer: Yes, I do.
+++ 00:00:28  +++
Patient: Okay. Well, I’ve done everything I can to try to catch the water, uh.. buckets and things like that, but it is getting worse and I was wondering when you might be able to get somebody over to repair that.
Interviewer: Yes. Uhm.. I’m sorry I haven’t been over. Uhm.. I’ve just been so busy.
+++ 00:00:52  +++
Patient: Well, I-- you know, my concern is that I can keep putting buckets out, but I am concerned that your ceiling is sustaining some pretty serious damage and- and as this thing gets worse, the repair job is going to become a larger repair job and I think at this point, just looking at it, it’s probably going to be a fairly simple repair and in a few days, it could get very complicated. So, that’s why I wanted to see if something could be done fairly soon. I- I think there’s some urgency to this.
Interviewer: Okay.
+++ 00:01:25  +++
Patient: So, when do you think you might get somebody over to do that?
Interviewer: Uhm.. yeah, it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it.
+++ 00:01:38  +++
Patient: You understand that in two weeks, I may have a flooded apartment, which could be much worse than what I’m dealing with now, which is catching a leak in a bucket.
Interviewer: Yeah.
+++ 00:01:51  +++
Patient: Does- does that concern you at all?
Interviewer: Yes, it does. I’m sorry and I agree with you that it’s an urgent matter. I just have a lot of other tenants with problems that are more serious right now.
+++ 00:02:04  +++
Patient: Well, this is cost-- it costs you money to repair. I’m- I’m thinking in terms of what this would cost you if you were going to repair it now versus what it’s going to cost you in two weeks.
Interviewer: Mm-hmm.
+++ 00:02:17  +++
Patient: What you’re going to have is a massive repair job on your hands in two weeks. That doesn’t concern you that much?
Interviewer: It does, but yeah, like I do all the repairs myself for the whole building. So, I have a list and you’re on the list, but there’s just some more urgent matters right now.
+++ 00:02:42  +++
Patient: Well, do you understand under Texas law I’m-- I can give you a request in writing and you have to respond to it in a number of days and I- I don’t want to push that because I think that-- I understand you have other things to do, but I’d really like to get this done informally just between us. Is- is there no way we can do that here in maybe a couple days?
Interviewer: Yeah. I- I understand your concern completely and you’re totally right. Uhm.. I just-- I don’t know right now what I can do about your problem. uhm...
+++ 00:03:18  +++
Patient: Actually, it’s your problem. This is your problem because you’re going to have a- a very expensive repair job here in even a week. So...
