Interviewer: Okay.
+++ 00:01:52  +++

+++ 00:02:40  +++
Patient: Any other questions about the neighborhood or the apartment complex?

Uhm.. uh.. you know, I usually wouldn’t go out walking after dark, but uhm.. yeah, it’s pretty safe, especially around the complex and there’s, you know, like I had said before, there are some-- there’s a nice uh.. walking trail that’s nearby that uhm.. is- is pretty and it- it’s-- on a nice day, it’s a really nice walk.
Interviewer: Okay. Great. Well, it was nice to meet you. I still need to go do some unpacking, uhm.. but yeah, it was nice to meet you and I’ll talk to you later.
