Interviewer:  Oh, thank you.  I think I'm pretty much uh.. all loaded in though.
+++ 00:00:51  +++
Patient:  Great.  Well listen, I have a bottle of wine in my apartment, I-- if you wanna come over and have some wine with me, that's great, if you want me to come over and bring you some wine, we can sit and get- get to know each other, that's good.  But if you'd rather be alone and take some time out to rest and all that, I understand it completely.  This is my phone number.  Call me if you need anything and I can tell you the ins and outs of the apartment building.
Interviewer:  Thank you.  That is so nice of you.

+++ 00:02:01  +++
Patient:  Oh yeah, we have a wide range of uh.. of restaurants here.  There's a- a little neighborhood, it's called the Fire- Firewheel and usually on the weekends they have some dancing there, they have little concerts.  It's not far from here.  If you do decide to go uh.. you do have to get there early because of the parking situation, the earlier you get- you get there the better chance you have of finding parking.  Uh.. I'm more than happy to take you out there, you know, whenever you're ready and
