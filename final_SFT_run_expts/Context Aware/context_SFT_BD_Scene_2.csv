Yeah, uhm.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks, before I'll have time to fix it.wer: Thanks, yeah, real quick, I'm sorry, before I let you go, uhm.. can you tell me what you've done about the problem so far? Okay, that sounds good. Uh.. just basically, you know, try to keep it dry, I've put a fan on there where it's leaking and uh.. to try to keep it dry so uh.. it won't make a hole in the wall. Okay, all right, yeah, that's a good idea.  Okay, uhm.. I then will let you go and will talk soon, okay? Bye-bye."," All right, thanks, bye."

Uhm.. it- it-- the- the leak has gotten much worse, uhm.. it's, like- like I have to switch out pans every few hours, uhm.. so uh.. do- do you have an estimated date or not date, but uh.. time when you'll be able to come out here, cause this is kind of urgent.  I don't want to- I don't want to get water damage. Okay, uhm.. yeah, I just have a lot of other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours right now. Okay, uhm.. do you have another maintenance man that could come out? Uhm.. I wish I did but I do all the repairs myself for the whole building so... Uh-huh, okay, no I understand.  Uhm.. is-- so, I- I still would like a, uhm.. a, uh.. a finish date by or an estimated date when you will come by.  I mean, you can give me that, right? Yeah, uh.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I'll have time to fix it.wer: Uh.. like I said... I do- I do all the repairs myself. And I know- I know- I know that you do all the repairs yourself but I can't wait for two weeks.  I am uh.. I- I cannot have the- the ceiling leaking for two weeks.  There's going to be so much water damage and especially when I'm gone at work, the house could be flooded. Yeah, I- I definitely understand.  Uhm.. can you tell me a little bit about what you've done about the problem so far? Well, I mean, I've done as much as I can.  I mean, I've- I've remove- I've removed delicate items from the area and have put the biggest pans that I can to stop the leak.  Uh.. there- there's not, I mean, I can't-- I'm not- I'm not an expert at fixing thing- at fixing ceilings and things.  That's not what I do, so I don't-- I'm not savvy on what I need to be doing but there's-- it's not patchable, if that makes sense. Okay, uhm.. yeah.  I definitely understand.  I actually have to go right now but uhm.. I'm still guessing that it's going to be at least a week or two weeks, uhm.. but I'll give you a call, okay? Yeah, so- so again, let me ask you.  I know that you do it yourself but if I decide to hire somebody to get it done before the two week mark, will you reimburse me for that? Uhm.. I may have to go at that time.  I understand that but I do-- I mean this how urgent, I need to know if uhm.. if you're going to-- well, I mean essentially take responsibility for your apartments. Yeah, no definitely, like I said I- I just like to do all the repairs myself and uhm.. I- I promise I can be there in a week or two weeks.  Uhm.. but unfortunately I don't know what else I can do.wer: Okay. Just what you've been doing is fine and uhm.. I'll make sure to fix anything that gets damaged. It's not going to be fine when I go back to work, because then I won't be able to switch them out every two hours and if it gets worse, then like I said there's going to be- there's going to be a problem."," Okay, all right, so we're going to..."

Uhm.. like I said, there are other problems that are more serious. Okay, I understand this. Uhm.. that’s all right. I will be contacting somebody that’s of a higher authority than you as a landlord, because I know there is something that can be done about this. Well, you don't need to call. I’m aware of the problem. I’ll be.. But being aware and not fixing it is two separate things. Right. I’m aware of the problem now and I’ll be over as soon as I can to fix it. Okay. So that like, what? In two weeks?"," No, I’ll be coming over around-- sometime today."
"  Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady. Yes ma’am. I’m Patient in Apartment 203, and I have uhm.. a leak in my ceiling that I had reported last week, and still nobody has came to fix it and it’s getting a lot worse. Uhm.. it didn’t sound that bad the last time you called. Well, at that point in time, it wasn’t, but it’s progressively gotten worse. And now there’s rings around the ceiling. You can see where it’s leaking and possibly mildewing the ceiling. And I think that if it doesn't get fixed soon, then it might be a bigger problem for y’all than it-- than it is for me. Uhm.. I’m sorry I haven’t had enough time to get over to fix it, but I’ve been very busy. Understandable. Understandable. This is quite a big complex. Do you have a maintenance man that I could expect to come by to fix it. I do all the repairs myself for the whole building. Oh, okay. So do you have any idea when you might be able to get to it? It might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks, before I’ll have time to fix it. Okay. Well, I mean, if you would like to at least come take a look at it, to see exactly how extensive the damage is going to be if it gets put off any longer.. Uhm.. well, I don't know what I can do about your problem right now. Well, no, it’s not my problem. It’s your problem because these are your apartments. I just happen to be a tenant. You are the landlord, and it is the responsibility of the landlord to make sure that things like this get taken care of swiftly. So what have you done about the problem so far? I have buckets underneath the leak, I have put towels all over the floor, and I’ve ruined some of my best linen trying to keep it from getting all over the rest of the apartment. Well.. Do you really think there’s anything more than I can do? Well, I have a lot of tenants with problems that are ahead of yours. Okay, I understand that, but are any of them going to be-- are they causing structural damage to the apartments that you run? Well, I have a list and you're on the list, but there are other problems that are more serious. Okay, a leak in the ceiling is not serious? Uhm.. like I said, there are other problems that are more serious. Okay, I understand this. Uhm.. that’s all right. I will be contacting somebody that’s of a higher authority than you as a landlord, because I know there is something that can be done about this. Well, you don't need to call. I’m aware of the problem. I’ll be.. But being aware and not fixing it is two separate things. Right. I’m aware of the problem now and I’ll be over as soon as I can to fix it. Okay.

"  Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlord. Hi, Interviewer, this is Patient in Apartment D160.  I called you last week, uh.. to let you know about the leak in the ceiling. Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I haven't had enough time to get over to fix it.  I've just been really busy lately. Okay, can you tell me when you're going to be able to fix it? Uh, right now, it might take about a week or maybe even two weeks before I'll have time to fix it. Okay, the slow leak that I had last week has now turned into a large leak and it's getting worse. Ooh, okay, uh.. it didn't sound that bad the last time you called. Of course, that's because I called last week and you haven't been out. Okay, uhm.. have you done anything about the problem so far? Uhm.. yeah, the only thing that I can do is put buckets down and try not to let the floor get too wet. Yeah, okay, uhm.. well, I have a list and you're on the list.  Uh.. there's just been other problems that are more serious. Okay, well, uhm.. all right, can-- you can either go ahead and come out here and make it a priority and fix this issue, or I can fix it on my own and take it out of the rent. Okay, uh. I like to do all the repairs myself for the whole building.  Uhm.. so I'd like to get out there and take a look myself. Okay, well, I would also like for my things to not be ruined.  I would like for mildew and mold not to grow into my home. Yeah, I- I understand, uhm.. I'm sorry, I've just had a lot of other tenants with problems that have been ahead of yours so. Okay, so what can we do to make this a priority? Uhm.. hmm, I can move you up a little bit on the list, but it still might take me a week or so before I am able to get out there. Okay, well, the rent is due on the 1st.  Would it be acceptable that I pay you on the 7th? Uhm.. that sounds like uh.. something we could explore, depending on how long this uh.. takes to get fixed. No, that wasn't the point.  I have the rent money. Okay. But basically what I'm saying is if it's taking you a week to come out here and fix it, uhm.. and I'm just waiting, you-- it wouldn't be acceptable to you if it took me a week to come pay you the rent money.

Okay, uhm.. well this has been leaking for a while.  It's getting worse.  I can give you 48 hours and after that, I'll uhm.. have no other choice but to have someone else come out to fix this."," Okay, there is no need to call anyone else.
