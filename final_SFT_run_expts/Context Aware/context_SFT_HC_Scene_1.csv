So, well cool.  Where are you from?  Uhm.. I'm actually from the other side of Dallas.  Are you?  Okay.  All right.  Well great to meet you.  Yeah.  We live in a pretty cool building, it's- it's uhm.. pretty quiet, thank goodness.  Uhm.. yeah, so I don't know a whole lot of- of our neighbors, but uhm.. it definitely is good to meet you, so yeah.  Yeah, it's good to meet you too.  Yeah, if you need anything, let me know.  I've been here for a while, I've lived in this complex forever actually, so.  Uhm.. you've been in Dallas for a while?  Yeah, a couple of years now.  Yeah, so, well cool.  Well the neighborhood's pretty good, there's a Kroger right down the block, uhm.. it's easy to get on the interstate from here.  Uhm.. yeah, so anyway well welcome to the building.  It's good to meet you.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Uhm.. before you go uhm.. since you know the area better than I do, is it safe to walk in this neighborhood in the evening?  Well <exhales deeply> uh... I'd say before dark it's okay, uhm.. I wouldn't go-- I mean after dark is probably all right uh.. but not too late.  Uhm.. especially since you're, you know, a young lady you probably wouldn't wanna hang out too late.  But, I mean I've lived here forever and I mean the general parking lot uh.. going to and from your car is probably okay.  Mm-hmm.  I wouldn't necessarily go walking around the complex real late at night or in the middle of the night uhm.. if you don't have to just play it safe, you know.  But in general the- it's a pretty safe neighborhood, yeah.  Okay, that's great to know then.  Do you <laughs>- do you need any help moving in?  Uhm…wer:  What's the landlord like?  I'm fine for now, but while you're here uhm.. I had another question.  Oh my gosh.  Well <sighs> they are not real responsive and if you call the office, they just let the phone ring.  So the best way if you need to get a hold of somebody in the office is just to- to go into the office uhm.. because uh.. it seems like they just are always busy with, you know.  But uhm.. it just depen-- I mean like what do you mean, uh.. just are they friendly or what…  Yeah, just in general like resp-- like you said <inaudible 00:02:47>.  Yeah, uhm..... they're not uh.. all that quick with maintenance requests, but uh.. we live in a big complex too, so you have to kinda know that it's gonna take 'em a little while.  But uhm.. yeah I- I have mixed feelings on the management, I-- yeah and it uh.. but that's apartment life I guess, so yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Well thank you for coming up to meet me.
