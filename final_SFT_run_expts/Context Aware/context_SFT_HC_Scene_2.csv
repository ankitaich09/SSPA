Sorry about that.

Well, I mean, I do the repairs myself for the whole building, so. Well, so, what you're saying is that you're not going to fix it? Well, I- I have a list, and you're on that list, there are just other problems that are more serious right now.

So can you please just let me know when you’ll be in? Uh.. I’m sorry I haven’t had enough time to come over and fix it.  I’ve just been really busy. Okay.  I do understand that, but it’s caused some serious problems, uhm.. and it’s also damaging uh.. my floors and also my- my uhm.. belongings.  So is there any way you could make it in today? Uhm.. I don’t know what I can do about your problem right now. Okay.  Well, I’m sorry, but somethin’ has to be done.  Uhm.. you know, I’m not paying uh.. rent here for my property to be damaged.  You know, it’s not my property.  You know, I don’t have a way to fix it myself.  If I did, I could.  Uhm.. but, you know, I really, you know, could use your help.  Is there not anyone else that maybe works with you that could possibly come in and help? Uh.. I just have a lot of other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours. Okay.  Well, definitely, you know, I’m gonna hafta, you know, call uhm.. someone in regards to this ‘cause this is definitely not, you know, professional behavior and I- I’m gonna make a complaint. Okay.  Well, you- you’re on my list.  I have a list.  You’re on the list, but there are just other problems that are more serious than yours. Well, definitely it could be an issue with my ceiling caving in with the water damage, and also, like I stated, you know, my property is bein’ damaged each day with the leak.  So uhm.. I’m not sure what the priority list is, but if you can’t make it today, I’m definitely gonna hafta call to make a complaint. Okay.  So it’ll take me about a week, maybe two weeks, for me to uhm.. be able to fix it. That is definitely completely not okay.  I’m sorry.  I’m gonna hafta call someone in regards to this matter. No, you don’t have to, ‘cause I do all the repairs myself for the building. No.  I can’t wait a week.  I’m sorry.  I can’t continue to, you know, have da-- further damage to my property, so I’m gonna hafta contact someone else in relation to this matter and I will be makin’ a complaint. Well, it didn’t sound that bad the last time you called. Uhm.. well, actually, two weeks ago wasn’t that bad, but, you know, with it not being repaired, you know, it just continuously got worse and worse. What- what have you done with the problem so far? There’s nothing I can do.  I’m not a repair person.  You know, I’m not mai- a maintenance person, so I don’t know anything about fixing the issue. Okay, I-- well, I’ve just been really busy. I understand that, and I’ve given you time to get to me, but this is really unprofessional and I pay my rent on time and this is just not the way you treat your good tenants.  I’m sorry."," All, right, all right.  Fine.  I will be over right away then."

But the problem is it’s not getting taken care of and, you know, we’re not coming up with any solutions today, so we’ve got to-- we’ve got to do something. I either need to call someone else, or you need to give me a date and time of when we can expect it, because, as of right now, not only is it not being fixed, but you can’t even give me a time or date when it will be fixed. Uh.. Well, it just didn’t sound that bad the last time you called. I know, but it’s getting-- the problem is with water, it’s just this l- length of time. It’s now getting worse, and worse, and worse. And I’m worried that it’s going to give you damage to the wood and cause mold and mildew and everything else. So, I really think that it’s even more urgent now than it was before. Uh.. I- i-- so, what have you done about the problem so far? I’ve tried to fix it myself, but I obviously don’t want to be put out e- expense-wise uhm.. for something that I think is the issue of the apartment. Uh.. Well, I do have a list and you're on that list. There are just other problems that are more serious right now. Okay. Uh.. How long do you think it would take to get through all of those problems on the list? I kind of need just a date and a time. Uh.. Well, it may take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it. Okay. I’m just really worried. I’m- I’m letting you know that the, you know, this water leak is getting really bad and it’s damaging the apartment. And I don’t want to pay for any-- uh.. I don’t want my security deposit p-- taken out because y- you don’t want to fix the problem. Uh.. W- well, uh.. is there anything else you’ve done about the problem so far? Uh.. Well, I’m- I’m thinking now that I might just get it taken care of and- and, you know, I might have to ask you for reimbursement. And if you don’t, I’ll-- might have to just take you to court to try and get it, if you don’t want to agree, because uhm.. yeah, it’s starting to become a health issue for us if there does happen to be mold and mildew that- that grows. So, uhm.. I would offer-- if you’re not going to be able to take it-- care of it for two weeks, that’s- that’s just too long. Well, I- I mean, like I said, you don’t need to call anyone. I- I’m aware of that problem and I’ll be over when I can. If that-- unfortunately, that doesn’t solve the problem. So, I’m going to go ahead and take- take whatever actions I need to to get it fixed. Okay, well, you know what? I think- I think you’ve convinced me. I’ll be right there. Perfect. Thank you.", Alright? Thanks. Bye.

I do all the repairs in the building myself.  Uhm.. well, you know, I have to work so if I even put a-- when I put the bucket there, the water's going all over as I'm working, so what would you like me to do?  Uhm.. I'm not sure.  Have you tried anything else, try to patch it or anything?  No.  If I patch it are you going to be paying-- or that's gonna come off my rent if I patch it and fix it myself or have somebody fix it?  Well we could work something out, but the actual work I have to do it.  So I still have to wait for you is what you're saying?  Yeah, that's the thing.wer:  Uh.. couple days maybe.  I'm really not sure.  Okay, well it's probably gonna be more of a headache for you than it will be for me <laughs> because the money will be coming out of your pocket, the- or all the damage I should say, so.  Have you spoken to the tenants above you, see where that leak might be coming from?  No, but I would assume it's probably from their bathtub.  Mm, okay.  Yeah, well I'll have…  It's just…  …I'll have to check with them as well, but…  Uh.. and I think that should be your job to call.  Yeah, I'll have to check with them as well, it's just gonna take me a little while.  Okay.  And how long do you think that's gonna take, another day or two <inaudible 00:07:30>?  Uh.. maybe- maybe a week or so.  A week before you get a hold of them?  Mm-hmm.  I'd probably have a better chance of just going up there and knocking on the door myself and then I can call you and tell you what the d- or why they're- it's leaking from up there.  Do you think that's a better idea?  Well, yeah if you could do that, that could work.wer:  Yeah, that- that would probably help.  Mm-hmm.  Probably be the best idea you think?  Mm-hmm.  <laughs> Yeah.  Like I said, you're- you're gonna wind up with most of the-- it's gonna be costing you more money the more that you keep putting it off.  Yeah, I know it's- it's just out of my hands.  Yeah well what are the other tenants' problems that are so-- are they more serious than mine, a leak?  Well yeah there are other problems that I can't tell you exactly what they are.  Why not?  <laughs>",

Before last week it was just a drip, now it's a constant flow.  Do you have any idea where the water is coming from?  The roof.  So…  That's all I know, I'm not a- a roofer.  Well it could be from the tenants above you, have you spoken to them?  No, I have not because everybody is not so nice and so I'd rather talk to you and you speak with the tenants.  Okay.  Well I'll do that.  The thing is I have you on a list, there are just other problems ahead of yours.  I don't s- see that any problem could be uh.. more urgent than mine because if my furniture gets damaged, you're gonna be liable because you didn't take care of the leak.  Well I don't think anything should get damaged since no…  We hope not.  Uh.. what-- have you tried anything to fix it?  Uh.. once again I'm not a roofer, I'm not a carpenter, I'm a nurse and that's what I do and so when I come home I expect my home to be dry and free of problems especially a leaking roof.  Okay, well I will definitely get to it, it's just gonna take me a little more time.  Okay.  It's all on you.  <laughs>  And when you come I'm gonna bake a- a apple pie.","  Oh, that's really nice of you."

It’s- it’s kind of like a, you know, a good size leak and I’m- I’m really afraid it’s gonna ruin the apart- the apartment and, you know, to save us both money, I-- you know, I’m trying to figure out a way to fix it somehow. Do you have any other options, anybody that you know I can speak to- to get this fixed? Uhm.. well, so, what have you done about the problem so far? So far, all I did was just call you. I- I didn’t want to make any adjustments, only because, you know, I didn’t want to be, you know, charged for something had I did taken it to- to you know, my own, uhm.. hands and- and I know in- in the lease agreement that we have, it- it says that you are gonna be responsible for all that. So, I just didn’t wanna, you know, step on anybody’s toes. Uhm.. so, I haven’t really done anything about it other than call you. So, I don’t know if there is something that I- I can do, I- I can most definitely look into   Mm-hmm. You don’t need to uh.. look into that. I’m aware of the problem. So, I’ll be over as soon as I can.wer: Yeah. Like I said, it might... Mm-hmm. It might take about a week, maybe two weeks before I’ll have time to get over. Okay. Uhm.. okay, well, is there anything that meanwhile, I can, you know, do you want me to put some towels somewhere? I mean, I’m- I’m gonna do that anyway just to kinda cover some of my stuff. So, uhm.. I have like a bucket right now to kinda cover the- the leak, but uhm.. you know, I guess if it- if it gets any worse, I’ll- I’ll give you a call, uhm.. is there anything else that you want me to do meanwhile?"," Uhm.. no, I’m not sure what else we can do about the problem right now."
