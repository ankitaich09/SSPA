There’s just been other problems that have been more serious that I’ve been tryin’ deal with.wer: Mm-hm. I- I do them all myself.  Uhm.. have you done anything about the problem so far? I called you.  I put a bucket down.  I put a bucket down.  I mean, if you want- if you want me to, I can call somebody and get them to come fix it but I’m- I’m afr-- wouldn’t you hafta pay for that? Uhm..--wer: Yeah.  I mean, uhm.. I would prefer to do it myself. Uhm.. so, like, uh.. you know, I’d appreciate it if uhm.. you could be patient, uhm.. so... How many people are ahead of us? Uhm.. I don’t have the list on me right now, but uhm.. you know, I think the week or two-week estimate is probably pretty accurate at this point. Week or two weeks.  Huh.  I don’t know what to say.

I’m sorry I haven’t had enough time to get over to fix it, but I’ve been very busy. Okay.  Well, the leak has gotten much worse now that we’ve let it uh.. pass a few days.  So it’s gotten much worse.  Is there anyone that’s gonna come and look at it soon? I have a list and you’re on the list, but there are other problems that are more serious. Okay.  So uhm.. how long do you think it’ll be before you can come and fix it? I’m not sure what I can do about your problem right now. Okay.  Uhm.. well, I’ll hold off for little days, but if it gets much worser I’m gonna need to move to another apartment.  Do you have another apartment op-- available? It didn’t sound that bad the last time you called. Well, yes.  But now that it’s been neglected it’s gotten worser and worse, and if we wait any longer it’ll be much worser. I have a lot of other tenants with problems that are currently ahead of yours. Okay.  I’ll wait.  If it’s not that bad, I’ll stay on.  If it gets really worse, then I want to know if I can move to another apartment. There currently aren’t any other apartments that you could move to. Okay.  So uhm.. we’ll just see how it goes from here then and see how long it takes you to come and fix it.  If it takes longer than I think is appropriate then I’ll just go ahead and contact the- the Tenants’ Association in regards to this uh.. situation. I do do all the repairs myself for the whole building. Okay.  All right.  Well, I’ll try to work with you then, okay? All right. And well, let’s see if we can get to it quicker and faster. Mm. Will that work for you? It might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it, but I’ll try to stop by as soon as I can. Okay.  Just come have a look at it and see how much worser it’s gotten to see if you can wait for longer than that, okay?", All right.

Uhm.. about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to get over there. Well, will I get a reduction in my rent if- if-- ‘cause uhm.. you know, it’s almost becoming unlivable because I’m scared the roof might fall in. Oh, wow. And I have a small child. Mm...

"  Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady. Hi, Ms. Jones, this is Patient once again, unit 201. I was calling you about a leak that's been going on. You know it's hurricane season and the leak has gotten worse, so I wanted to know if you're going to, you told me that you was going to come yesterday, and send somebody to come look at it, but, you know, there's a guy, the super down the hall has a brother that does roofing. Would that be okay if I have him come take a look at it if you're too busy, or are you just going to come through? Uhm.. I do all the repairs myself for the whole building. So what's taking you so long to come because the- the leak is spreading and it has damaged my, uhm.. my laptop, it's getting my clothes wet, my carpet smells. I'm just really starting to get frustrated, and you already went up on the rent $50.00. So what am I supposed to do, just wait around? Tomorrow is the 4th of July, so when would you be coming in? I'm sorry, I haven't had enough time to get over to fix it, but I've been very busy. Okay, no problem. Do you mind if I just go into a hotel for like two or three days until you get a chance to get to it and then I'll just take it out of the rent?", It didn't sound that bad the last time you called.
