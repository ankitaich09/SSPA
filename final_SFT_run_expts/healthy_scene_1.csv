Uhm, not really, no.  Well, if I could make a recommendation, I’m two months into doing yoga, and it’s a life changer.  Oh, really?  I’ve heard that.  Yeah, well, <laughs> I mean, two months, I mean, I really know nothing, and I can still barely touch my toes, but…  <laughs>  … it’s still a great time.  So if you find yourself with too much time on your hands, which I doubt you do, then uh.. I would say go for yoga a little bit.  Thank you for the recommendation.  Yeah, absolutely.

Uh.. before you go, what's the landlord like here? Uh.. he's pretty nice.  Uh.. always helpful, tries to help out, tries to understand if you've got any problems.  Uh.. I think, my recommendation is be real with him, try not to, you know, lie, saying you're going to do something you're not, just-- I think he's a good guy.  He'll try to help you out.  Uh.. that's pretty much it on the landlord.  Uh.. any other questions?  Any-, anything else? Yeah, uhm.. I like to take walks so is it safe to walk in the neighborhood in the evening? Uh.. yeah, uh.. it's just as safe as anywhere else, just uh.. you don't want to go out, you know, just you don't want to be out late, too late, you know, you never know what's going to happen that night, uh.. but yeah, it's pretty safe.  I'm comfortable walking late at night, uh.. so yeah.  It's pretty safe, I-- that's my recommendation on that. And uhm.. are the residents in the building friendly? Uh.. yeah, I never had any problems with them.  Uh.. you know, we walk by, say what's up, and just little small talk here about sports or anything- anything, we just-- that comes up in the conversation so they're pretty cool.  They're- they're not rude or troublesome or anything.  They don't make too much noise at night, you know, they try to keep it respectful.  It's all good here.  The people here are pretty good, no- no bad people. Okay, oh, that's great.  Uhm.. I still have to finish unpacking but thank you for coming to meet me. You're welcome.

Uhm.. yeah.  I’ve-- it’s a-- I’ve lived here for quite some time.  It’s a good neighborhood.  Uhm.. you know, uh.. we’ve got lots of friendly people around here and we’ve got our own neighborhood association.  If you’re interested in coming to meetings, they generally post them uh.. once a month.  You’ll see signs on the corners for them, uhm.. and if you ever need anything from me I’ll give you my number so you can contact me. Great. All right.  All right.  Well, it’s nice to meet you.  Uhm.. I’ll go in and write my number down and bring it back out to you. Okay. Great.  All right.  Well, have a great day. Uh.. so have you lived here long? Uhm.. I’ve lived here three years now.

I believe he works for Interstate Batteries uhm.. as an executive.  He- he’s a nice guy though, uhm.. if you can catch him.  Anything else? Uh.. well, I do hafta go to work in the morning.  Where’s the bus downtown? Uhm.. I’m uh.. not terribly sure, but I know if you go onto DART’s website uhm.. you can put in your address and map-- and also the address to where you’re trying to get to and it will show you the best route to follow to get that- that information.  ‘Cause I wouldn’t wanna tell you and then get it wrong, so... <laughs> Uh.. anything else? Uhm.. would you say that it’s safe to walk in the neighborhood in the evening? Oh, yeah.  I’ve never had a problem.  Uhm.. you could probably look up the, you know, any statistics on Dallas Police.  They have a w-- on their website they have all the statistics for issues, but I’ve never had a problem in the three years I’ve been here, so... Any other questions? Uh.. what’s the landlord like? Uhm.. the current manager, uhm.. she’s- she’s very nice.  Uhm.. she’s been here uh.. since the building was uh.. built, I guess, as far as I know.  Uhm.. and she has an assistant who’s also very friendly.  I’ve never had any problems with them and they’re very-- generally pretty responsive if I have a maintenance issy- issue or anything.

Excellent, well, if you ever need anything I'm around.  Uh..

If you ever see anyone over, just invite yourself over but I'll invite you if I see you. That sounds great, thank you. You're welcome.  Do you like doing things, uh.. particular for fun?

But, you know, you got to watch out and I'm the kind of guy that likes to watch out for my neighbors, so, you know, I would expect the same. If you have an issue or something like that, just let me know what-- You're safe here so if anything is out of the norm that you- you're not used to, just holler, you know, let one of-- somebody, one of my friends know to see if it's okay or-- It's nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. <laughs> Have a good day. Uh.. Well, I am new to the area. Could you tell me about the neighborhood? Well, the neighborhood, well, it's- it's- it's okay. You know, you got your hit and misses over here. You know, for the most part, you know, everybody just kind of stays to their self. You know, it's really not a lot of noise. Kind of family-oriented area, so, you know, you'll probably see a lot of kids playing around. You might have to get on them here and there, you know. I kind of treat them like my own kids, you know; if I see them getting into something, I kind of, like, let them know. So but other than that it's pretty cool. You know, the cops, they patrol the area. So I mean, your stuff is safe here. So   <laughs> Other than that, if you just, you mind your business, you know, everybody's gonna respect you and kind of, you know, leave you in your little- little space and whatnot. But it's an all right area. It's cool. So welcome to the neighborhood. Thanks.wer: Uh.. uh.. So what's the landlord like? Okay. The landlord? I mean, now she- she's pretty cool. As long as you pay your rent, you know, on time, she's all right. But if you have a issue, you know, with maybe paying or something or something in the building or whatnot, something needs to be replaced, let them know. They kind of, you know, take their time about things. You probably have to stay on them, you know, if you you got an issue, you know, with some appliances or something that's going out that they need to take care of or what not. But it's- it's okay. They don't mess with you here, you know. They kind of leave you alone and they don't-- they're not bugs, like, I call them bugaboos. <laughs> They always want to be in your business of what you doing here, but they- they kind of leave you-- they laid back here. Okay, good. All right, well, it was nice meeting you. It's nice meeting you, too, man. I'll see you around. I'll see you around too, man. Take care. Bye.","Interest: 5.0

It’s uhm.. in Plano wh- where we live it’s supposed to be the next New York is what they said, and uh.. I think the average income is $70,000 a year.  So mean, it’s a very safe city.   The-- whenever the police are called, if necessary, the whole department shows up.  So uh.. but anyway, uhm.. it’s- it’s a great place.  It’s-- there’s a lot in the-- just in this block.  You can get somethin’ to eat, get your haircut and pick out an outfit somewhere.  There’s that much around.  Like I said, they’re- they’re calling Plano the next New York, so uh.. but I think you’ll find it pretty comfortable here.  It’s a nice city.  Anything else that you wanted to know about the apartment complex or...? Uhm.. so what is the landlord like? Landlord?  Uh.. she’s happy with you as long as you pay your bills on time. <laughs> That’s the main thing.  Like any manager.  They’re all about numbers, so long as you pay your rent on time, she’s- she’s happy. <clears throat> But... What do you-- do you smoke or anything? No, not really. <clears throat> Oh, you don’t?  Wow.  Uh.. I was smokin’ the other day on my patio and a neighbor came by and held their nose and I’m like, “What the-- what’s the- what’s the deal?” <laughs> “This is a free country.”  And I was on my patio, ‘cause I don’t like to smoke inside, you know. Mm-hm. I don’t like to smell myself but I, you know, kinda understand, but I was just like-- that was kind of weird that somebody would, you know, ‘cause I was like 10, 15 feet away from ‘em.  You know, was kind of strange they would react that way to cigarette smoke, but whatever.  It’s a free country, right? <laughs> Uh.. so would you say that it’s safe to walk in the neighborhood in the evening? Absolutely.  For- for a guy or, you know, if I was a young teenager, you know, if you had a daughter 11 or 12, uh.. they should be in by 10 I would think, but other than that, you know, you’re- you’re pretty safe.  You don’t need to pack heat.  Or carry any Mace or anything.  It’s pretty-- like I said, it’s a pretty safe neighborhood, and if you have a dog or anything, that’s always extra helpful, but uh..-- All right.  Well, it was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you too.
