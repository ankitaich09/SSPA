0,00:00:00, ," Hi.  This is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:11," Hello, Interviewer.  Uhm.. how are you?", I’m doing well.
2, 00:00:15, That’s good.  Uhm.. I was actually wanting to just uhm.. address you about a leak in my ceiling that I need fixed immediately and to see when the next time would you be able to send someone out to fix it?, Hm.  So uhm.. what have you done about the problem so far?
3, 00:00:33," Uhm.. well, I’ve reported it and uhm.. they say that they will get to it, but they haven’t got to it yet."," Hm.  Yeah, I have a lot of other tenants with problems that are ahead of yours."
4, 00:00:47, Okay.  Uhm.. is there a way that you can possibly get out this week?," Uhm.. I have a list and you’re on the list, but there are other problems that are more serious."
5, 00:01:01," Okay.  Uhm.. well, what should I do in the meantime?  Is it, I mean, can I-- since it’s leaking, what should I do in the meantime?"," Well, I don’t know what I can do about your problem right now."
6, 00:01:16," Okay.  Uhm.. well, the water’s leaking all on my furniture.  I had to move it out the way.  My furniture’s expensive.  Uhm.. is there a way that I could possibly like stay in another unit until it’s fixed?", Hm.  It didn’t sound that bad the last time you called.
7, 00:01:35, It’s gotten worse. <laughs>," Hm.  Well, I do all the repairs for my uh.. myself for the whole building."
8, 00:01:45," Okay.  Well, uh.. what number am I on the list?", Uhm.. I’m not sure.
9, 00:01:53," Oh, okay.  Well, do you think that you’ll be able to get back to me uhm.. before you go home today?", Uhm.. I’m not sure about that.  I’m pretty busy right now.
10, 00:02:10," Uhm.. okay.  Uhm.. well, I’m not sure what do to ‘cause it really needs to be fixed and it’s gotten a lot worse from last time I told you about it.", Hm.
11, 00:02:27, Uhm.. <laughs> I guess I’ll just hafta wait then and just continue to move my furniture out the way and just uhm.. leave the area clear of anything., Uhm.. it might take me about a week or maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it.
12, 00:02:55," Oh, my gosh.  I need it fixed immediately.  Uhm.. well, I’m not sure to do if you’re not available."," Uhm.. well, it sounds pretty serious, so I’ll be over as soon as I can."
13, 00:03:12," Oh, okay.  Great.  Thank you.", All right.  Talk to you later.  Bye.
