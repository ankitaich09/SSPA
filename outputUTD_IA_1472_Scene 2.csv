1, 00:03:27,"wer:  Oh sorry, go ahead.",  Hi uhm..
2, 00:00:28,wer:  Uhm.. I think you just called me.,  Mm-hmm.
3, 00:00:36,"  Oh.  Hello Interviewer, this is Patient _______ 00:00:39 over at Address.  Uh.. I talked to you and/or your husband last week, <clears throat> did you get the text or the letter that I wrote you concerning the leak?  Uhm.. your husband said he would be over to fix it within the next day or so, I haven't heard from you or him and the leak is", 
4, 00:01:10, ,"  Yeah, I'm so sorry that you've been dealing with that and that we haven't had enough time to get over to fix it.  Uhm.. I'm thinking that it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I'll have time to fix it."
5, 00:01:33,"  Interviewer, the wa-- <laughs> the leak has gotten worse, uh.. I do not want my things ruined or wet uhm.... can you get over here any sooner than that?","  Uhm.. I'm not sure right now, I just have-- I have a list and you're on the list, but there's some other problems that are just more serious right now."
6, 00:02:03,"  Okay.  Well is it possible for me to have the leak fixed myself and just take it out of the rent?  Uhm.. I can't afford for the problem to get worse, uhm.. although I do have renters' insurance, I- I just don't want the problem to get worse, I don't want my furniture and stuff to get wet.","  Yeah, I completely understand and that's a really good idea uhm.. that we could maybe look into, but as of right now I do all the repairs myself for the building."
7, 00:02:44,"  Okay, and if the problem gets worse, what do you plan to do about it?","  Uh.. I will definitely fix the problem and whatever happens due to the leak uhm.. so yes, that is of course my plan is to fix it."
8, 00:03:02,"  Okay.  Uhm.. I hear what you're saying, but uh.. I think that the problem can be fixed now by me rather than allowing the problem to get worse and then being fixed by you later.  Uh.. like I said, I- I don't want my furniture wet and uhm.. I just think that it would be best for me to go ahead and fix it uhm.. because the hole is getting larger.",
