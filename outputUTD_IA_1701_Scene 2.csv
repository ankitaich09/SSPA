1, 00:00:13,"  Hi. This is Patient. Uhm.. I called you earlier about the leak in the ceiling. It's really becoming uhm.. a hassle and bothersome. I think if we leave it like this there'll be mold, and it's unhealthy. Could you please help me fix this on top [ph?]?","  Yes, of course. I'm so sorry that I haven't been able to get over to fix it. I've just been so busy."
2, 00:00:45,wer:  Uhm.. I wish I...,"  I wish I could do it today, but I have uhm.. a lot-- so I have a list, and you're on the list, but there's some other tenants that have problems ahead of yours that are more serious."
3, 00:01:09,"  Well, this is pretty serious too. I just wanted to let you know. Please. It's with urgency. Please help me. <inaudible 00:01:19> That's all.","  All right. Well, I do appreciate you calling. Uhm.. can you tell me what you've done about the problem so far?"
4, 00:01:44,  Yes. I have a bucket uh.. underneath the- the ceiling that- that has been affected.,  What was that? I'm sorry.
5, 00:02:00,  Yes. I have a bucket underneath the part of the ceiling that's been affected.,"  Oh, I see. Okay. Uhm.. well, yeah, it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I'll be able to come over to fix it."
6, 00:02:30,  Do you think if I call a outside uh.. maintenance man-- do you think you could cover the cost?,  That's a really good idea uhm.. but I actually prefer to do the repairs myself for the whole building.
7, 00:02:54,"  Okay. Well, I can't live like this. I might need to stay somewhere else if it's unsanitary.","  Okay. Uhm.. well, I'm- I'm sorry again that this is going on. Uhm.. I am aware of the problem, and so I will be over as soon as I can. I just don't know what I can do right now."
8, 00:03:25,  Oh.,
