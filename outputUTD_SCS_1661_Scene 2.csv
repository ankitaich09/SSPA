1, 00:00:15," Hi. Uhm.. so, I call you yesterday and the other day about my ceiling. There’s a leak and you have not responded. I don't know why because it’s a very- very serious matter and I’ve been calling forever. You will not take anything. Would you tell me when it’s going to be fixed because you no say a thing."," Yeah, I’m sorry. Uhm.. I just haven’t had enough time to get over and fix it yet. I’ve been very busy."
2, 00:00:49," But I think you can find somebody just to-- they don’t have to come. You don’t fix. You’ll find somebody. So, I don't know why I have to wait until you backfill that or whatever you’re doing to wait until you cannot fix it. Why can’t you send somebody to come help me out?"," Uhm.. you know, I actually do all the repairs myself for the whole building."
3, 00:01:16," Can you <inaudible 00:01:17> like a whole week and like he said in the house “I don't know what’s next,” and right now I’m to wait. So, I don't know how long you’re going to take because I don’t completely understand can you not be coming so how long I'm going to wait <inaudible 00:01:36>?"," Uhm.. you know, it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
4, 00:01:47, And I don’t think I can wait that long., Uhm.. I’m- I’m sorry. I just-- I don't know what I can do about the problem right now.
5, 00:02:05," What about you send somebody? It won’t cost you a lot and if there’s somebody you know who can fix it because everything is <inaudible 00:02:14> for another two weeks. So, it won’t take so much. You can just send somebody, a friend or somebody you trust with to come help with the repair. But he can do some-- a bit of fix and then when you come, you can do the plumbing part, the- the good fixing, at hold out before you catch up."," Yeah. I’m sorry. There’s- there’s not really anybody else I can send. Uhm.. you know, like I said, I- I do all the repairs myself for the whole building."
6, 00:02:49," So, what do you want me to do? Just stay here and we can take it from there?"," Uhm.. you know, I have a list and you’re on the list. Uh.. there are just other problems that I have to take care of before yours."
7, 00:03:05," So, it means <inaudible 00:03:07> my issue or is my issue not big enough to be <inaudible 00:03:13>?"," Uhm.. I mean, yeah, like I said, it- it’s gonna be about a week, maybe even two weeks before I’ll have time to fix it."
8, 00:03:26," Okay. I think I’ll fix the problem myself. So, I won’t call you again. I think I’ll fix it on my own.", Okay.
