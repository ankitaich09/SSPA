0,00:00:00, ," Hi, this is Interviewer, the landlady."
1, 00:00:13," Hey, Interviewer. Uh.. you know, last time I talked to you, we were talking about the slow leak I have going on in my apartment and uh.. I was just asking you about it and I seen that it’s getting worse. You know, it’s actually started to damage your floors and stuff, something very expensive to be repaired and not only that, also causing issues for me because I have to clean the mess up. So, uh.. anyways, I was just wondering uh.. what’s going on and uh.. I’ll see you out here to fix it pretty soon."," Oh, I’m sorry that I haven’t enough time to get over to fix it, but I have been super busy."
2, 00:00:48," Mm-hmm. Oh, I understand.", Yeah.
3, 00:00:52," I understand, Interviewer. It’s uh.. I know, life gets a little hectic and stuff. So, anyways, uh.. anyways, uh.. maybe you could contact somebody else to do it or something or uh.. you know...", Wow. Yeah. I...
4, 00:01:05," Hire somebody to do it, but you really need to get it done."," Yeah. I uhm.. it might take me about a week, maybe even two weeks before I have time to fix it."
5, 00:01:19," Really, Interviewer? Because it’s actually, the leak’s getting really bad and uh.. it’s-- you know, it’s gonna-- if you don’t get to it soon, it’s gonna cause permanent damage, I think, to the structure of your building here. That’s gonna really deteriorate your uh.. your value of your house or your apartment building. So, uh.. you know, and it’s also-- it’s gonna be a costly job if you just let it sit here. So, you might want to figure on stopping that."," Well, it didn’t sound that bad the last time you called."
6, 00:01:51,wer: I don't know what I can do about your problem right now., Hmm. Yeah. I do all the repairs myself for the whole building and for now...
7, 00:02:08," Yeah. That sounds tough. Say uh.. if you ever want, I actually can fix most things uh.. if you would uh.. take some money off my rent, I can fix it for you?"," Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can do it by yourself. Like, what have you done about it so far?"
8, 00:02:26," So far, just stuck a bucket underneath it trying to keep the floors from getting damaged, you know, just trying to look out for you. But uh.. you know, I could actually take a closer look at it and get some uh.. some sealant and fix the pipes up myself if you like.", Mm.
9, 00:02:44," I just have to ask you to take some money off my rent, maybe like $150 or so."," Wow. Hmm. Well, I will try to be there like as soon as I can."
10, 00:03:01," All right. If you want to do it yourself, that’s- that’s fine by me, man. Uh.. just uh.. obviously, get here quick because it’s, you know, sometimes I’ll be at work and the bucket will overflow and well, get- get water on the floor...", Okay.
11, 00:03:14, And damage the floors., Okay. I’ll be there like as soon as possible. Okay?
12, 00:03:21, Thanks. That would be awesome. Thank you., Bye.
